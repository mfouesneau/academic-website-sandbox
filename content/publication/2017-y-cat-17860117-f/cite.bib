 abstract = {For this paper, we use the list of 601 high-probability cluster
candidates from the Johnson et al. (2012, J/ApJ/752/95) Year 1
catalog, which contains integrated photometry through six
broadband filters from the UV to the near-infrared: F275W (UV),
F336W (U), F475W (g), F814W (I), F110W (J), F160W (H). Clusters
were detected by eye, primarily based on the F475W images, and
visually classified based on their sizes, shapes, and
concentrations as explained in Johnson et al. (2012,
J/ApJ/752/95). \\(1 data file).},
