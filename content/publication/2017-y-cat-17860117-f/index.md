abstract: "For this paper, we use the list of 601 high-probability cluster candidates from the Johnson et al. (2012, J/ApJ/752/95) Year 1 catalog, which contains integrated photometry through six broadband filters from the UV to the near-infrared: F275W (UV), F336W (U), F475W (g), F814W (I), F110W (J), F160W (H). Clusters were detected by eye, primarily based on the F475W images, and visually classified based on their sizes, shapes, and concentrations as explained in Johnson et al. (2012, J/ApJ/752/95). (1 data file)."
