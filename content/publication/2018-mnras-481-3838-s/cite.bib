 abstract = {The early Universe presented a star formation environment that was
almost devoid of heavy elements. The lowest metallicity stars
thus provide a unique window into the earliest Galactic stages,
but are exceedingly rare and difficult to find. Here, we present
the discovery of an ultra-metal-poor star,
Pristine_221.8781+9.7844, using narrow-band Ca H&K photometry
from the Pristine survey. Follow-up medium- and high-resolution
spectroscopy confirms the ultra-metal-poor nature of
Pristine_221.8781+9.7844 ([Fe/H] = -4.66 \ensuremath±
0.13 in 1D LTE) with an enhancement of 0.3-0.4 dex in
\ensuremathα-elements relative to Fe, and an unusually
low carbon abundance. We derive an upper limit of A(C) = 5.6,
well below typical A(C) values for such ultra-metal-poor stars.
This makes Pristine_221.8781+9.7844 one of the most metal-poor
stars; in fact, it is very similar to the most metal-poor star
known (SDSS J102915+172927). The existence of a class of ultra-
metal-poor stars with low(er) carbon abundances suggest that
there must have been several formation channels in the early
Universe through which long-lived, low-mass stars were formed.},
