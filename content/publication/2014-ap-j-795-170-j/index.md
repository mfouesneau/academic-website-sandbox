abstract: "Using Hubble Space Telescope photometry to measure star formation histories, we age-date the stellar populations surrounding supernova remnants (SNRs) in M31 and M33. We then apply stellar evolution models to the ages to infer the corresponding masses for their supernova progenitor stars. We analyze 33 M33 SNR progenitors and 29 M31 SNR progenitors in this work. We then combine these measurements with 53 previously published M31 SNR progenitor measurements to bring our total number of progenitor mass estimates to 115. To quantify the mass distributions, we fit power laws of the form dN/dMvpropM $^-ensuremathα$. Our new larger sample of M31 progenitors follows a distribution with ensuremathα =4.4$^+0.4$$_-0.4$, and the M33 sample follows a distribution with ensuremathα =3.8$^+0.4$$_-0.5$. Thus both samples are consistent within the uncertainties, and the full sample across both galaxies gives ensuremathα =4.2$^+0.3$$_-0.3$. Both the individual and full distributions display a paucity of massive stars when compared to a Salpeter initial mass function, which we would expect to observe if all massive stars exploded as SN that leave behind observable SNR. If we instead fix ensuremathα = 2.35 and treat the maximum mass as a free parameter, we find M $_max$ åisebox-0.5ex~ 35-45 M $_ensuremathødot$, indicative of a potential maximum cutoff mass for SN production. Our results suggest that either SNR surveys are biased against finding objects in the youngest (<10 Myr old) regions, or the highest mass stars do not produce SNe."
