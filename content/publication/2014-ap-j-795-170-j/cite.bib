 abstract = {Using Hubble Space Telescope photometry to measure star formation
histories, we age-date the stellar populations surrounding
supernova remnants (SNRs) in M31 and M33. We then apply stellar
evolution models to the ages to infer the corresponding masses
for their supernova progenitor stars. We analyze 33 M33 SNR
progenitors and 29 M31 SNR progenitors in this work. We then
combine these measurements with 53 previously published M31 SNR
progenitor measurements to bring our total number of progenitor
mass estimates to 115. To quantify the mass distributions, we
fit power laws of the form dN/dMvpropM
$^-\ensuremathα$. Our new larger sample of M31
progenitors follows a distribution with \ensuremathα
=4.4$^+0.4$$_-0.4$, and the M33 sample follows a
distribution with \ensuremathα =3.8$^+0.4$$_-0.5$.
Thus both samples are consistent within the uncertainties, and
the full sample across both galaxies gives \ensuremathα
=4.2$^+0.3$$_-0.3$. Both the individual and full
distributions display a paucity of massive stars when compared
to a Salpeter initial mass function, which we would expect to
observe if all massive stars exploded as SN that leave behind
observable SNR. If we instead fix \ensuremathα = 2.35
and treat the maximum mass as a free parameter, we find M
$_max$ åisebox-0.5ex~ 35-45 M
$_\ensuremathødot$, indicative of a potential maximum
cutoff mass for SN production. Our results suggest that either
SNR surveys are biased against finding objects in the youngest
(<10 Myr old) regions, or the highest mass stars do not produce
SNe.},
