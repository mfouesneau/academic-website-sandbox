 abstract = {We measure the mass function for a sample of 840 young star clusters
with ages between 10 and 300 Myr observed by the Panchromatic
Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey in M31. The data show
clear evidence of a high-mass truncation: only 15 clusters more
massive than \10\$^4$ \M\$_\ensuremathødot $ are
observed, compared to the \ensuremath∼100 expected for a
canonical \M\$^-2$ pure power-law mass function with the
same total number of clusters above the catalog completeness
limit. Adopting a Schechter function parameterization, we fit a
characteristic truncation mass of
\M\$_c$=\8.5\$_-1.8$$^+2.8$× \10\$^3$ M
$_\ensuremathødot$. Although previous studies have
measured cluster mass function truncations, the characteristic
truncation mass we measure is the lowest ever reported.
Combining this M31 measurement with previous results, we find
that the cluster mass function truncation correlates strongly
with the characteristic star formation rate surface density of
the host galaxy, where \M\$_c$∝ <
\\\\ensuremathΣ \\\$_\SFR$\\>
\$^\ensuremath∼ 1.1$. We also find evidence that
suggests the observed M $_ c $-\\\\ensuremathΣ
\\\$_\SFR$\ relation also applies to globular clusters,
linking the two populations via a common formation pathway. If
so, globular cluster mass functions could be useful tools for
constraining the star formation properties of their progenitor
host galaxies in the early universe.},
