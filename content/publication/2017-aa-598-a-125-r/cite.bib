 abstract = {We present a non-parametric model for inferring the three-dimensional
(3D) distribution of dust density in the Milky Way. Our approach
uses the extinction measured towards stars at different
locations in the Galaxy at approximately known distances. Each
extinction measurement is proportional to the integrated dust
density along its line of sight (LoS). Making simple assumptions
about the spatial correlation of the dust density, we can infer
the most probable 3D distribution of dust across the entire
observed region, including along sight lines which were not
observed. This is possible because our model employs a Gaussian
process to connect all LoS. We demonstrate the capability of our
model to capture detailed dust density variations using mock
data and simulated data from the Gaia Universe Model Snapshot.
We then apply our method to a sample of giant stars observed by
APOGEE and Kepler to construct a 3D dust map over a small region
of the Galaxy. Owing to our smoothness constraint and its
isotropy, we provide one of the first maps which does not show
the ``fingers of God'' effect.},
