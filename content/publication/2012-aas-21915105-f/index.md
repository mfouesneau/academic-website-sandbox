abstract: "The Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey provides multi- wavelength coverage of nearly one-third of M31, including thousands of stellar clusters. The sensitivity of HST extends the cluster sample well into the low mass regime, where stochastic effects of luminous stars can significantly influence the observed integrated light, and must be properly considered when deriving cluster ages and masses. We have applied a Bayesian analysis technique to account for variations in the integrated cluster light to derive the ages and masses of the 600 clusters from the Year 1 PHAT observations. Here we present the first results from our characterization of cluster properties, including a comparison with traditional methods of cluster age and mass determination. The large population of low mass clusters in the PHAT sample also provides for best constraints on the cluster mass function outside of the Magellanic Clouds."
