 abstract = {The Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey provides multi-
wavelength coverage of nearly one-third of M31, including
thousands of stellar clusters. The sensitivity of HST extends
the cluster sample well into the low mass regime, where
stochastic effects of luminous stars can significantly influence
the observed integrated light, and must be properly considered
when deriving cluster ages and masses.
\\We have applied a Bayesian analysis
technique to account for variations in the integrated cluster
light to derive the ages and masses of the 600 clusters from the
Year 1 PHAT observations. Here we present the first results from
our characterization of cluster properties, including a
comparison with traditional methods of cluster age and mass
determination. The large population of low mass clusters in the
PHAT sample also provides for best constraints on the cluster
mass function outside of the Magellanic Clouds.},
