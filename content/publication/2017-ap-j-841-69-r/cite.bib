 abstract = {We present a framework to simultaneously constrain the values and
uncertainties of the strength of convective core overshooting,
metallicity, extinction, distance, and age in stellar
populations. We then apply the framework to archival Hubble
Space Telescope observations of six stellar clusters in the
Large Magellanic Cloud that have reported ages between
\ensuremath∼ 1\--\2.5 \Gyr\. Assuming a canonical
value of the strength of core convective overshooting, we
recover the well-known age-metallicity correlation, and
additional correlations between metallicity and extinction and
metallicity and distance. If we allow the strength of core
overshooting to vary, we find that for intermediate-aged stellar
clusters, the measured values of distance and extinction are
negligibly effected by uncertainties of core overshooting
strength. However, cluster age and metallicity may have
disconcertingly large systematic shifts when
\\\\ensuremathŁambda \\\$_\$̧\\ is allowed to
vary by more than +/- 0.05 \H\$_p$. Using the six stellar
clusters, we combine their posterior distribution functions to
obtain the most probable core overshooting value,
\0.500\$_-0.134$$^+0.016$\H\$_p$, which is in line
with canonical values.},
