 abstract = {We present the Pristine survey, a new narrow-band photometric survey
focused on the metallicity-sensitive Ca H&K lines and conducted
in the Northern hemisphere with the wide-field imager MegaCam on
the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. This paper reviews our
overall survey strategy and discusses the data processing and
metallicity calibration. Additionally we review the application
of these data to the main aims of the survey, which are to
gather a large sample of the most metal-poor stars in the
Galaxy, to further characterize the faintest Milky Way
satellites, and to map the (metal-poor) substructure in the
Galactic halo. The current Pristine footprint comprises over
1000 deg$^2$ in the Galactic halo ranging from b
\ensuremath∼ 30° to
\ensuremath∼78° and covers many known stellar
substructures. We demonstrate that, for Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) stellar objects, we can calibrate the photometry at the
0.02-mag level. The comparison with existing spectroscopic
metallicities from SDSS/Sloan Extension for Galactic
Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE) and Large Sky Area Multi-
Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope shows that, when combined
with SDSS broad-band g and I photometry, we can use the CaHK
photometry to infer photometric metallicities with an accuracy
of \ensuremath∼0.2 dex from [Fe/H] = -0.5 down to the
extremely metal-poor regime ([Fe/H] < -3.0). After the removal
of various contaminants, we can efficiently select metal-poor
stars and build a very complete sample with high purity. The
success rate of uncovering [Fe/H]$_SEGUE$ < -3.0 stars among
[Fe/H]$_Pristine$ < -3.0 selected stars is 24 per cent, and 85
per cent of the remaining candidates are still very metal poor
([Fe/H]<-2.0). We further demonstrate that Pristine is well
suited to identify the very rare and pristine Galactic stars
with [Fe/H] < -4.0, which can teach us valuable lessons about
the early Universe.},
