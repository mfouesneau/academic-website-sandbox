 abstract = {In order to empirically determine the time-scale and environmental
dependence of stellar cluster disruption, we have undertaken an
analysis of the unprecedented multipointing (seven),
multiwavelength (U, B, V, H\ensuremathα, and I) Hubble
Space Telescope imaging survey of the nearby, face-on spiral
galaxy M83. The images are used to locate stellar clusters and
stellar associations throughout the galaxy. Estimation of
cluster properties (age, mass, and extinction) was done through
a comparison of their spectral energy distributions with simple
stellar population models. We constructed the largest catalogue
of stellar clusters and associations in this galaxy to-date,
with \ensuremath∼1800 sources with masses above
\ensuremath∼5000 M$_\ensuremathødot$ and ages
younger than \ensuremath∼300 Myr. In this Letter, we
focus on the age distribution of the resulting clusters and
associations. In particular, we explicitly test whether the age
distributions are related with the ambient environment. Our
results are in excellent agreement with previous studies of age
distributions in the centre of the galaxy, which gives us
confidence to expand out to search for similarities or
differences in the other fields which sample different
environments. We find that the age distribution of the clusters
inside M83 varies strongly as a function of position within the
galaxy, indicating a strong correlation with the galactic
environment. If the age distributions are approximated as a
power law of the form \d N/dt\\ensuremath∝
t\̂\ensuremathζ \, we find \ensuremathζ
values between 0 and -0.62 (\ensuremathζ
\ensuremath∼ -0.40 for the whole galaxy), in good
agreement with previous results and theoretical predictions.
