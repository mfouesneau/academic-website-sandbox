abstract: "In order to empirically determine the time-scale and environmental dependence of stellar cluster disruption, we have undertaken an analysis of the unprecedented multipointing (seven), multiwavelength (U, B, V, Hensuremathα, and I) Hubble Space Telescope imaging survey of the nearby, face-on spiral galaxy M83. The images are used to locate stellar clusters and stellar associations throughout the galaxy. Estimation of cluster properties (age, mass, and extinction) was done through a comparison of their spectral energy distributions with simple stellar population models. We constructed the largest catalogue of stellar clusters and associations in this galaxy to-date, with ensuremath∼1800 sources with masses above ensuremath∼5000 M$_ensuremathødot$ and ages younger than ensuremath∼300 Myr. In this Letter, we focus on the age distribution of the resulting clusters and associations. In particular, we explicitly test whether the age distributions are related with the ambient environment. Our results are in excellent agreement with previous studies of age distributions in the centre of the galaxy, which gives us confidence to expand out to search for similarities or differences in the other fields which sample different environments. We find that the age distribution of the clusters inside M83 varies strongly as a function of position within the galaxy, indicating a strong correlation with the galactic environment. If the age distributions are approximated as a power law of the form d N/dtensuremath∝ t̂ensuremathζ , we find ensuremathζ values between 0 and -0.62 (ensuremathζ ensuremath∼ -0.40 for the whole galaxy), in good agreement with previous results and theoretical predictions.
