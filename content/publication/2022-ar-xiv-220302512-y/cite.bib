 abstract = {The C-19 stream is the most metal poor stellar system ever discovered,
with a mean metallicity $[Fe/H] = -3.38±0.06$. Its low
metallicity dispersion ($σ_m̊ [Fe/H]$ $<$ 0.18 at the
95\% confidence level) as well as variations in
sodium abundances strongly suggest a globular cluster origin. In
this work, we use VLT/UVES spectra of seven C-19 stars to derive
more precise velocity measurements for member stars, and to
identify two new members with radial velocities and
metallicities consistent with the stream's properties. One of
these new member stars is located 30 $°$ away from the
previously identified body of C-19, implying that the stream is
significantly more extended than previously known and that more
members likely await discovery. In the main part of C-19, we
measure a radial velocity dispersion $σ_v$ =
6.2$^+2.0_-1.4$ km s$^-1$ from nine members, and a stream
width of 0.56$°±0.08°$, equivalent to $∼$158 pc at a
heliocentric distance of 18 kpc. These confirm that C-19 is
comparatively hotter, dynamically, than other known globular
cluster streams and shares the properties of faint dwarf galaxy
streams. On the other hand, the variations in the Na abundances
of the three newly observed bright member stars, the variations
in Mg and Al for two of them, and the normal Ba abundance of the
one star where it can be measured provide further evidence for a
globular cluster origin. The tension between the dynamical and
chemical properties of C-19 suggests that its progenitor
experienced a complex birth environment or disruption history.},
