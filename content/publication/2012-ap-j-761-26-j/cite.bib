 abstract = {Using Hubble Space Telescope photometry, we age-date 59 supernova
remnants (SNRs) in the spiral galaxy M31 and use these ages to
estimate zero-age main-sequence masses (M $_ZAMS$) for their
progenitors. To accomplish this, we create color-magnitude
diagrams (CMDs) and employ CMD fitting to measure the recent
star formation history of the regions surrounding cataloged SNR
sites. We identify any young coeval population that likely
produced the progenitor star, then assign an age and uncertainty
to that population. Application of stellar evolution models
allows us to infer the M $_ZAMS$ from this age. Because our
technique is not contingent on identification or precise
location of the progenitor star, it can be applied to the
location of any known SNRs. We identify significant young star
formation around 53 of the 59 SNRs and assign progenitor masses
to these, representing a factor of
åisebox-0.5ex~2 increase over currently
measured progenitor masses. We consider the remaining six SNRs
as either probable Type Ia candidates or the result of core-
collapse progenitors that have escaped their birth sites. In
general, the distribution of recovered progenitor masses is
bottom-heavy, showing a paucity of the most massive stars. If we
assume a single power-law distribution, dN/dMvpropM
$^\ensuremathα$, then we find a distribution that is
steeper than a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF)
(\ensuremathα = -2.35). In particular, we find values
of \ensuremathα outside the range -2.7 >=
\ensuremathα >= -4.4 to be inconsistent with our
measured distribution at 95% confidence. If instead we assume a
distribution that follows a Salpeter IMF up to some maximum
mass, then we find that values of M $_Max$ > 26 are
inconsistent with the measured distribution at 95% confidence.
In either scenario, the data suggest that some fraction of
massive stars may not explode. The result is preliminary and
requires more SNRs and further analysis. In addition, we use our
distribution to estimate a minimum mass for core collapse
between 7.0 and 7.8 M $_\ensuremathødot$.},
