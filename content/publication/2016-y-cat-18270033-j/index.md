abstract: "The Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey imaged 1/3 of the disk of M31 in six passbands spanning near-ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths. The survey provides resolved stellar photometry of 117 million sources that we use to determine the properties of both the cluster and field populations, with completeness limits that allow the detection of individual MS stars down to åisebox-0.5ex~3M$_̇o$. Here we provide an overview of the crowded field stellar photometry derived for PHAT; full details are found in Dalcanton+ (2012ApJS..200...18D) and Williams+ (2014, J/ApJS/215/9). (1 data file)."
