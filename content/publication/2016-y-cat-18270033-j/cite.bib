 abstract = {The Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey imaged 1/3 of
the disk of M31 in six passbands spanning near-ultraviolet to
near-infrared wavelengths. The survey provides resolved stellar
photometry of 117 million sources that we use to determine the
properties of both the cluster and field populations, with
completeness limits that allow the detection of individual MS
stars down to åisebox-0.5ex~3M$_̇o$.
Here we provide an overview of the crowded field stellar
photometry derived for PHAT; full details are found in
Dalcanton+ (2012ApJS..200...18D) and Williams+ (2014,
J/ApJS/215/9). \\(1 data file).},
