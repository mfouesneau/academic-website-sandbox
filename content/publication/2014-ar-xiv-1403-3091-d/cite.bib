 abstract = {We present a study on the gender balance, in speakers and attendees, at
the recent major astronomical conference, the American
Astronomical Society meeting 223, in Washington, DC. We
conducted an informal survey, yielding over 300 responses by
volunteers at the meeting. Each response included gender data
about a single talk given at the meeting, recording the gender
of the speaker and all question-askers. In total, 225 individual
AAS talks were sampled. We analyze basic statistical properties
of this sample. We find that the gender ratio of the speakers
closely matched the gender ratio of the conference attendees.
The audience asked an average of 2.8 questions per talk. Talks
given by women had a slightly higher number of questions asked
(3.2$±$0.2) than talks given by men (2.6$±$0.1). The most
significant result from this study is that while the gender
ratio of speakers very closely mirrors that of conference
attendees, women are under-represented in the question-asker
category. We interpret this to be an age-effect, as senior
scientists may be more likely to ask questions, and are more
commonly men. A strong dependence on the gender of session
chairs is found, whereby women ask disproportionately fewer
questions in sessions chaired by men. While our results point to
laudable progress in gender-balanced speaker selection, we
believe future surveys of this kind would help ensure that
collaboration at such meetings is as inclusive as possible.},
