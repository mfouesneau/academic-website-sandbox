\\\\ensuremath√òmega \\\$_\\P$\\ would produce
age gradients across spiral arms. We test whether such age
gradients are present in M81 by deriving the recent star
formation histories (SFHs) of 20 regions around one of M81's
grand-design spiral arms. For each region, we use resolved
stellar populations to determine the SFH by modeling the
observed color-magnitude diagram constructed from archival
Hubble Space Telescope F435W and F606W imaging. Although we
should be able to detect systematic time delays in our spatially
resolved SFHs, we find no evidence of star formation propagation
across the spiral arm. Our data therefore provide no convincing
evidence for a stationary density wave with a single pattern
speed in M81, and instead favor the scenario of kinematic spiral
patterns that are likely driven by tidal interactions with the
companion galaxies M82 and NGC 3077.},
