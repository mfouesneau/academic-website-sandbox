 abstract = {Pulsating stars, such as Cepheids, Miras, and RR Lyrae stars, are
important distance indicators and calibrators of the
“cosmic distance ladder,”
and yet their period-luminosity-metallicity (PLZ) relations are
still constrained using simple statistical methods that cannot
take full advantage of available data. To enable optimal usage
of data provided by the Gaia mission, we present a probabilistic
approach that simultaneously constrains parameters of PLZ
relations and uncertainties in Gaia parallax measurements. We
demonstrate this approach by constraining PLZ relations of type
ab RR Lyrae stars in near-infrared W1 and W2 bands, using Tycho-
Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) parallax measurements for a
sample of \ensuremath≈100 type ab RR Lyrae stars
located within 2.5 kpc of the Sun. The fitted PLZ relations are
consistent with previous studies, and in combination with other
data, deliver distances precise to 6% (once various sources of
uncertainty are taken into account). To a precision of 0.05 mas
(1\ensuremathσ), we do not find a statistically
significant offset in TGAS parallaxes for this sample of distant
RR Lyrae stars (median parallax of 0.8 mas and distance of 1.4
kpc). With only minor modifications, our probabilistic approach
can be used to constrain PLZ relations of other pulsating stars,
and we intend to apply it to Cepheid and Mira stars in the near
future.},
