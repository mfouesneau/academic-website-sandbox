 abstract = {There is currently a great divide between high resolution studies of
stellar clusters and molecular clouds in the Milky Way, and
those done in extragalactic systems, where individual stars and
clouds cannot usually be resolved. For my thesis work, I
combined several astronomical data sets to investigate the life
cycle of molecular clouds in the Andromeda Galaxy. The primary
data sets I used are the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury
(PHAT), which catalogued over 200 million stars, and a molecular
cloud catalogue that is constructed from new high
spatial/spectral resolution (20 pc, 1 km/s) CARMA observations.
Several ancillary data sets, including H-alpha and Spitzer IR
emission maps were also used, taking advantage of broad
wavelength coverage to search for indicators of star formation
with different timescales. Comparisons were also made with the
PHAT cluster sample, and the youngest (<10 Myr) stellar clusters
were used as an additional star formation indicator. The ages
and masses of these clusters were determined by fitting the
color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of their resolved stars to
theoretical isochrones. The distribution of the youngest
clusters shows a strong correlation with the molecular cloud
distribution, while no correlation is evident for clusters
greater than 30 Myr. Each molecular cloud in the sample was then
classified as a star-forming cloud or a non-star forming cloud,
based on the presence of any one of several star formation
indicators. About 60% of the clouds in the sample were found to
be associated with massive star formation. Based on the
comparison between these observations and the results from a
Monte Carlo simulation, I will also demonstrate how we can
constrain the timescales for the relative phases in a cloud's
life.},
