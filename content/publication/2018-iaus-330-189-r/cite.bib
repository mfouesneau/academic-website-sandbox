 abstract = {We present a model to map the 3D distribution of dust in the Milky Way.
Although dust is just a tiny fraction of what comprises the
Galaxy, it plays an important role in various processes. In
recent years various maps of dust extinction have been produced,
but we still lack a good knowledge of the dust distribution. Our
presented approach leverages line-of-sight extinctions towards
stars in the Galaxy at measured distances. Since extinction is
proportional to the integral of the dust density towards a given
star, it is possible to reconstruct the 3D distribution of dust
by combining many lines-of-sight in a model accounting for the
spatial correlation of the dust. Such a technique can be used to
infer the most probable 3D distribution of dust in the Galaxy
even in regions which have not been observed. This contribution
provides one of the first maps which does not show the ``fingers
of God'' effect. Furthermore, we show that expected high
precision measurements of distances and extinctions offer the
possibility of mapping the spiral arms in the Galaxy.},
