 abstract = {We search the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys
and Wide Field Camera 3 broadband imaging data from the
Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey to identify
detections of cataloged planetary nebulae (PNs). Of the 711 PNs
currently in the literature within the PHAT footprint, we find
467 detected in the broadband. For these 467, we are able to
refine their astrometric accuracy from
åisebox-0.5ex~0.``3 to 0.''05. Using the
resolution of the HST, we are able to show that 152 objects
currently in the catalogs are definitively not PNs, and we show
that 32 objects thought to be extended in ground-based images
are actually point-like and therefore good PN candidates. We
also find one PN candidate that is marginally resolved. If this
is a PN, it is up to 0.7 pc in diameter. With our new
photometric data, we develop a method of measuring the level of
excitation in individual PNs by comparing broadband and
narrowband imaging and describe the effects of excitation on a
PN's photometric signature. Using the photometric properties of
the known PNs in the PHAT catalogs, we search for more PNs, but
do not find any new candidates, suggesting that ground-based
emission-line surveys are complete in the PHAT footprint to
