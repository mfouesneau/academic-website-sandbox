 abstract = {The tables give the perihelion (closest approach) parameters of stars in
the Gaia-DR2 catalogue which are found by numerical integration
through a Galactic potential to approach within 10pc of the Sun.
These parameters are the time (relative to the Gaia measurement
epoch), heliocentric distance, and heliocentric speed of the
star at perihelion. Uncertainties in these have been calculated
by a Monte Carlo sampling of the data to give the posterior
probability density function (PDF) over the parameters. For each
parameter, three summary values of this PDF are reported: the
median, the 5% lower bound, the 95% upper bound. The latter
two give a 90% confidence interval. The table also reports the
measured parallax, proper motion, radial velocity (plus
uncertainties), and mass of the stars. A second table reports
additional data, in particular astrometric quality metrics, from
the Gaia-DR2 catalogue. Tables 2 and 3 in the article list the
first 31 lines of these data tables (stars with median
perihelion distances below 1pc). Stars with problematic data
have not been removed, so some encounters are not reliable.
