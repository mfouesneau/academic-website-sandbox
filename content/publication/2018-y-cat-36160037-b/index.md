abstract: "The tables give the perihelion (closest approach) parameters of stars in the Gaia-DR2 catalogue which are found by numerical integration through a Galactic potential to approach within 10pc of the Sun. These parameters are the time (relative to the Gaia measurement epoch), heliocentric distance, and heliocentric speed of the star at perihelion. Uncertainties in these have been calculated by a Monte Carlo sampling of the data to give the posterior probability density function (PDF) over the parameters. For each parameter, three summary values of this PDF are reported: the median, the 5% lower bound, the 95% upper bound. The latter two give a 90% confidence interval. The table also reports the measured parallax, proper motion, radial velocity (plus uncertainties), and mass of the stars. A second table reports additional data, in particular astrometric quality metrics, from the Gaia-DR2 catalogue. Tables 2 and 3 in the article list the first 31 lines of these data tables (stars with median perihelion distances below 1pc). Stars with problematic data have not been removed, so some encounters are not reliable. (2 data files)."
