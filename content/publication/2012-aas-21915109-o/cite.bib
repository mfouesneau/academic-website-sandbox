 abstract = {We describe a method for automatic detection of star clusters in M31,
using the multi-band images taken with the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) as part of the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda
Treasury (PHAT). Our method relies on the fact that at the
distance of M31, images of star clusters observed with HST
contain both a resolved stellar population and a significant
amount of unresolved light. First, we use the point source
photometry generated as part of the PHAT pipeline to subtract
point sources from the images, leaving behind only the
unresolved light, in addition to image artifacts. Next, we use
the filtered, subtracted images to identify peaks in unresolved
light. We compare these peaks to the point source photometric
catalog to remove some of the contaminants and to identify
likely candidate clusters. Finally, we employ neural network
techniques to remove additional contaminants. Tests of the
method show that we can automatically identify 85-90% of star
clusters identified through by-eye searches, as well as find
additional possible star clusters not found by eye.
Implementation of this method will allow for the quantitative
measurement of star cluster detection probability and
completeness in the PHAT data, something which will be otherwise
difficult to accomplish with by-eye searches.},
