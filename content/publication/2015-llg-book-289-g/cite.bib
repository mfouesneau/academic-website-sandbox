 abstract = {We investigate the clustering of early-type stars younger than 300 Myr
on galactic scales in M31. Based on the stellar photometric
catalogs of the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury program
that also provides stellar parameters derived from the
individual energy distributions, our analysis is focused on the
young stars in three star-forming regions, located at
galactocentric distances of about 5, 10, and 15 kpc,
corresponding to the inner spiral arms, the ring structure, and
the outer arm, respectively. We apply the two-point correlation
function to our selected sample to investigate the clustering
behavior of these stars across different time- and length-
scales. We find that young stellar structure survives across the
whole extent of M31 longer than 300 Myr. Stellar distribution in
all regions appears to be self-similar, with younger stars being
systematically more strongly clustered than the older, which are
more dispersed. The observed clustering is interpreted as being
induced by turbulence, the driving source for which is probably
gravitational instabilities driven by the spiral arms, which are
stronger closer to the galactic centre.},
