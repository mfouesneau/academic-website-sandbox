 abstract = {The Red Clump (RC) and lesser-known early-AGB bump (AGBb) are
recognizable features on the stellar color-magnitude diagram
(CMD). The timescale of evolution along the red giant branch
(RGB) and horizontal branch (HB) dictates the relative number of
stars in each feature and the brightness at which they occur.
Thus, they are sensitive to the various theoretical
perscriptions employed by stellar evolution models for initial
helium abundance, RGB mass loss, and convective overshooting.
Previous work exploiting the utility of these features was done
with Milky Way globular clusters; this work extends the
investigation to an extragalactic environment using deep six-
filter photometry from the PHAT survey in M31. We compare
observed properties of the AGBb and RC with model predictions to
empirically constrain input physics from the Padova stellar
evolution models.PHAT is supported by HST GO-12055 administered
