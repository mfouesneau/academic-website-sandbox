abstract: "The Red Clump (RC) and lesser-known early-AGB bump (AGBb) are recognizable features on the stellar color-magnitude diagram (CMD). The timescale of evolution along the red giant branch (RGB) and horizontal branch (HB) dictates the relative number of stars in each feature and the brightness at which they occur. Thus, they are sensitive to the various theoretical perscriptions employed by stellar evolution models for initial helium abundance, RGB mass loss, and convective overshooting. Previous work exploiting the utility of these features was done with Milky Way globular clusters; this work extends the investigation to an extragalactic environment using deep six- filter photometry from the PHAT survey in M31. We compare observed properties of the AGBb and RC with model predictions to empirically constrain input physics from the Padova stellar evolution models.PHAT is supported by HST GO-12055 administered by NASA."
