abstract: "We present a new technique for mapping the distribution of dust in external galaxies. We use near-infrared stellar photometry to measure the distribution of reddening with åisebox-0.5ex~20pc resolution in M31, using data from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT). Specifically, we model the color-magnitude diagram of red giant branch stars as a combination of a narrow, unreddened foreground population and a background population that samples lines of sight through a log-normal distribution of extinction. We then fit the color-magnitude diagram to derive the median extinction, the dimensionless width of the log-normal, and the fraction of reddened stars, in 20pc bins. The maps show superb morphological agreement with other dust tracers (i.e., emission from dust and gas), but have a factor of >4 times better resolution, while providing a more direct measurement of the dust column. The fits are less robust at very low extinctions, where they become sensitive to the exact structure of the unreddened red giant branch. We diagnose a significant calibration issue with widely- used dust models, which overpredict the observed extinction by a factor of i̊sebox-0.5ex~2 when modeling the dust emission. Fixing this calibration error would significantly revise the dust budget in local galaxies. In contrast, our results agree well with extinctions predicted from the gas distribution, asssuming a standard Milky Way gas-to-dust ratio."
