 abstract = {We present a new technique for mapping the distribution of dust in
external galaxies. We use near-infrared stellar photometry to
measure the distribution of reddening with
åisebox-0.5ex~20pc resolution in M31, using
data from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT).
Specifically, we model the color-magnitude diagram of red giant
branch stars as a combination of a narrow, unreddened foreground
population and a background population that samples lines of
sight through a log-normal distribution of extinction. We then
fit the color-magnitude diagram to derive the median extinction,
the dimensionless width of the log-normal, and the fraction of
reddened stars, in 20pc bins. The maps show superb morphological
agreement with other dust tracers (i.e., emission from dust and
gas), but have a factor of >4 times better resolution, while
providing a more direct measurement of the dust column. The fits
are less robust at very low extinctions, where they become
sensitive to the exact structure of the unreddened red giant
branch. We diagnose a significant calibration issue with widely-
used dust models, which overpredict the observed extinction by a
factor of \i̊sebox-0.5ex~2 when modeling the
dust emission. Fixing this calibration error would significantly
revise the dust budget in local galaxies. In contrast, our
results agree well with extinctions predicted from the gas
distribution, asssuming a standard Milky Way gas-to-dust ratio.},
