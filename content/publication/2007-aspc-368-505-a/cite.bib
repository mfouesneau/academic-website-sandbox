 abstract = {Thanks to the automatic solar features detection developed in the frame
of the European EGSO (European Grid of Solar Observations)
\\project, an important part of the
automation of Meudon Synoptic Maps is achieved. Nevertheless,
the tracking of these solar structures over time has still to be
done to synthesize their evolution during a Carrington rotation.
A new approach to track filaments, based on image segmentation
and intersection of regions of interest, gives successful
results, This is a major step to move towards a fully automatic
building of Meudon Synoptic Maps of Solar Activity.},
