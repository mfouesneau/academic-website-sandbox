 abstract = {We present ages and masses for 601 star clusters in M31 from the
analysis of the six filter integrated light measurements from
near-ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths, made as part of
the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT). We derive the
ages and masses using a probabilistic technique, which accounts
for the effects of stochastic sampling of the stellar initial
mass function. Tests on synthetic data show that this method, in
conjunction with the exquisite sensitivity of the PHAT
observations and their broad wavelength baseline, provides
robust age and mass recovery for clusters ranging from
åisebox-0.5ex~10$^2$ to 2 ×
10$^6$ M $_\ensuremathødot$. We find that the cluster
age distribution is consistent with being uniform over the past
100 Myr, which suggests a weak effect of cluster disruption
within M31. The age distribution of older (>100 Myr) clusters
falls toward old ages, consistent with a power-law decline of
index -1, likely from a combination of fading and disruption of
the clusters. We find that the mass distribution of the whole
sample can be well described by a single power law with a
spectral index of -1.9 \ensuremath± 0.1 over the range of
10$^3$-3 × 10$^5$ M
$_\ensuremathødot$. However, if we subdivide the sample
by galactocentric radius, we find that the age distributions
remain unchanged. However, the mass spectral index varies
significantly, showing best-fit values between -2.2 and -1.8,
with the shallower slope in the highest star formation intensity
regions. We explore the robustness of our study to potential
systematics and conclude that the cluster mass function may vary
with respect to environment. \\Based
