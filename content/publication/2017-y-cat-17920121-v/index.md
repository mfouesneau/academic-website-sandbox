abstract: "The Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) is a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) multi-cycle imaging survey covering roughly one- third of M31's star-forming disk out to 20 kpc (Dalcanton et al. 2012ApJS..200...18D). Observations were made with the HST using the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3), with six filters spanning the UV (WFC3/UVIS F275W and F336W), the optical (ACS/WFC F475W and F814W), and the NIR (WFC3/IR F110W and F160W). (3 data files)."
