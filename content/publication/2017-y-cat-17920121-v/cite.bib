 abstract = {The Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) is a Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) multi-cycle imaging survey covering roughly one-
third of M31's star-forming disk out to 20 kpc (Dalcanton et al.
2012ApJS..200...18D). Observations were made with the HST using
the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and Wide Field Camera 3
(WFC3), with six filters spanning the UV (WFC3/UVIS F275W and
F336W), the optical (ACS/WFC F475W and F814W), and the NIR
(WFC3/IR F110W and F160W). \\(3 data
