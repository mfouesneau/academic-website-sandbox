 abstract = {We present a mock catalog of Milky Way stars, matching in volume and
depth the content of the Gaia data release 2 (GDR2). We
generated our catalog using Galaxia, a tool to sample stars from
a Besançon Galactic model, together with a realistic 3D
dust extinction map. The catalog mimics the complete GDR2 data
model and contains most of the entries in the Gaia source
catalog: five-parameter astrometry, three-band photometry,
radial velocities, stellar parameters, and associated scaled
nominal uncertainty estimates. In addition, we supplemented the
catalog with extinctions and photometry for non-Gaia bands. This
catalog can be used to prepare GDR2 queries in a realistic
runtime environment, and it can serve as a Galactic model
against which to compare the actual GDR2 data in the space of
observables. The catalog is hosted through the virtual
observatory GAVO\textquoterights Heidelberg data center (<A hr
ef=``http://dc.g-vo.org/tableinfo/gdr2mock.main''>http://dc.g-vo
.org/tableinfo/gdr2mock.main</A>) service, and thus can be
queried using ADQL as for GDR2 data.},
