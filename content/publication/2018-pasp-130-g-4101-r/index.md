abstract: "We present a mock catalog of Milky Way stars, matching in volume and depth the content of the Gaia data release 2 (GDR2). We generated our catalog using Galaxia, a tool to sample stars from a Besançon Galactic model, together with a realistic 3D dust extinction map. The catalog mimics the complete GDR2 data model and contains most of the entries in the Gaia source catalog: five-parameter astrometry, three-band photometry, radial velocities, stellar parameters, and associated scaled nominal uncertainty estimates. In addition, we supplemented the catalog with extinctions and photometry for non-Gaia bands. This catalog can be used to prepare GDR2 queries in a realistic runtime environment, and it can serve as a Galactic model against which to compare the actual GDR2 data in the space of observables. The catalog is hosted through the virtual observatory GAVOtextquoterights Heidelberg data center (<A hr ef=``http://dc.g-vo.org/tableinfo/gdr2mock.main''>http://dc.g-vo .org/tableinfo/gdr2mock.main</A>) service, and thus can be queried using ADQL as for GDR2 data."
