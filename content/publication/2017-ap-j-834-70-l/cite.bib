 abstract = {We present synthetic far- and near-ultraviolet (\FUV\ and \NUV\)
maps of M31, both with and without dust reddening. These maps
were constructed from spatially resolved star formation
histories (SFHs) derived from optical Hubble Space Telescope
imaging of resolved stars, taken as part of the Panchromatic
Hubble Andromeda Treasury program. We use stellar population
synthesis modeling to generate synthetic UV maps with a spatial
resolution of \ensuremath∼100 pc (\ensuremath∼24
arcsec), projected. When reddening is included, these maps
reproduce all of the main morphological features in the GALEX
imaging, including rings and large star-forming complexes. The
predicted UV flux also agrees well with the observed flux, with
median ratios between the modeled and observed flux of \\log\
\$_10$(\f\$_\FUV$\$^\syn$\/\f\$_\FUV$\$^\ob
s$\)=0.03+/- 0.24 and \\log\\$_10$(\f\$_\NUV$\$^\
syn$\/\f\$_\NUV$\$^\obs$\)=-0.03+/- 0.16 in the
\FUV\ and \NUV\, respectively. This agreement is
particularly impressive given that we used only optical
photometry to construct these UV maps. Having verified the
synthetic reddened maps, we use the dust-free maps to examine
properties of obscured flux and star formation. We compare our
dust-free and reddened maps of \FUV\ flux with the observed
GALEX \FUV\ flux and \FUV\ + 24 \ensuremathμm flux to
examine the fraction of obscured flux. We find that the maps of
synthetic flux require that \ensuremath∼90% of the
\FUV\ flux in M31 is obscured by dust, while the GALEX -based
methods suggest that \ensuremath∼70% of the \FUV\ flux
is absorbed by dust. This 30% increase in the estimate of the
obscured flux is driven by significant differences between the
dust-free synthetic \FUV\ flux and that derived when
correcting the observed \FUV\ flux for dust absorption with 24
\ensuremathμm emission observations. The difference is
further illustrated when we compare the SFRs derived from the
\FUV\ + 24 \ensuremathμm flux with the 100 Myr average
SFR from the CMD-based SFHs. We find that the 24
\ensuremathμm corrected \FUV\ flux underestimates the
SFR by a factor of 2.3-2.5, depending on the chosen calibration.
This discrepancy could be reduced by allowing for variability in
the weight applied to the 24 \ensuremathμm data, as has
been recently suggested in the literature.
