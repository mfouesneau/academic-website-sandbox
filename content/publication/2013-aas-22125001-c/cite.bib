 abstract = {We study the relationship between the field star formation and cluster
formation properties in a large sample of nearby dwarf galaxies.
We use optical data from the Hubble Space Telescope and from
ground-based telescopes to derive the ages and masses of the
young (t_age < 100 Myr) cluster sample. Our data provides the
first constraints on two proposed relationships between the star
formation rate of galaxies and the properties of their cluster
systems in the low star formation rate regime. The data show
broad agreement with these relationships, but significant
galaxy-to-galaxy scatter exists. In part, this scatter can be
accounted for by simulating the small number of clusters
detected from stochastically sampling the cluster mass function.
However, stochasticity does not fully account for the observed
scatter in our data suggesting there may be true variations in
the fraction of stars formed in clusters in dwarf galaxies.
Comparison of the cluster formation and the brightest cluster in
our sample of galaxies also provide constraints on cluster
destruction models.},
