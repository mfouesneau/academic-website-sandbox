 abstract = {The 4MOST instrument is a multi-object spectrograph that will address
Galactic and extragalactic science cases simultaneously by
observing targets from a large number of different surveys
within each science exposure. This parallel mode of operation
and the survey nature of 4MOST require some distinct 4MOST-
specific operational features within the overall operations
model of ESO. The main feature is that the 4MOST Consortium will
deliver, not only the instrument, but also contractual services
to the user community, which is why 4MOST is also described as a
facility. This white paper concentrates on information
particularly useful to answering the forthcoming Call for
Letters of Intent.},
