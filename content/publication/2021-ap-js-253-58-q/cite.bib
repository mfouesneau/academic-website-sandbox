 abstract = {We analyze 4050 wide binary star systems involving a white dwarf (WD)
and usually a main-sequence (MS) star, drawn from the large
sample assembled by Tian et al. Using the modeling code BASE-9,
we determine the system's ages, the WD progenitors' zero-age MS
masses, the extinction values (A$_V$), and the distance
moduli. Discarding the cases with poor age convergences, we
obtain ages for 3551 WDs, with a median age precision of \ensur
emathσ$_\ensuremathτ$/\ensuremathτ =
20%, and system ages typically in the range of 1-6 Gyr. We
validated these ages against the very few known clusters and
through cross validation of 236 WD-WD binaries. Under the
assumption that the components are coeval in a binary system,
this provides precise age constraints on the usually low-mass MS
companions, mostly inaccessible by any other means.},
