 abstract = {We construct a stellar cluster catalog for the Panchromatic Hubble
Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey using image classifications
collected from the Andromeda Project citizen science website. We
identify 2753 clusters and 2270 background galaxies within
\ensuremath∼0.5 deg$^2$ of PHAT imaging searched, or
\ensuremath∼400 kpc$^2$ in deprojected area at the
distance of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). These identifications
result from 1.82 million classifications of
\ensuremath∼20,000 individual images (totaling
\ensuremath∼7 gigapixels) by tens of thousands of
volunteers. We show that our crowd-sourced approach, which
collects >80 classifications per image, provides a robust,
repeatable method of cluster identification. The high spatial
resolution Hubble Space Telescope images resolve individual
stars in each cluster and are instrumental in the factor of
\ensuremath∼6 increase in the number of clusters known
within the survey footprint. We measure integrated photometry in
six filter passbands, ranging from the near-UV to the near-IR.
PHAT clusters span a range of \ensuremath∼8 magnitudes in
F475W (g-band) luminosity, equivalent to \ensuremath∼4
decades in cluster mass. We perform catalog completeness
analysis using >3000 synthetic cluster simulations to determine
robust detection limits and demonstrate that the catalog is 50%
complete down to \ensuremath∼500
\\M\$_\ensuremathødot $\ for ages <100 Myr. We
include catalogs of clusters, background galaxies, remaining
unselected candidates, and synthetic cluster simulations, making
all information publicly available to the community. The catalog
published here serves as the definitive base data product for
PHAT cluster science, providing a census of star clusters in an
\\L\$^⋆ $\ spiral galaxy with unmatched
sensitivity and quality.},
