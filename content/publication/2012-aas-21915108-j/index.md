abstract: "Using high-resolution, multi-wavelength imaging of M31 from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) multi-cycle program, we have begun to assemble one of the largest and most complete samples of stellar clusters in a disk galaxy to date. We present the Year 1 cluster catalog that includes 600 high- quality objects, representing the first installment of a 2500 object sample expected from the full dataset. HST's exquisite resolution and sensitivity has allowed us to identify hundreds of new clusters that push well into the low luminosity regime, down to M(V) -2. We present luminosity functions and structural parameters of the Year 1 clusters, compare our results to previous cluster studies in M31, and highlight interesting science results made possible by this incredible dataset."
