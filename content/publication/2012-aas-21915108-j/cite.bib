 abstract = {Using high-resolution, multi-wavelength imaging of M31 from the
Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) multi-cycle
program, we have begun to assemble one of the largest and most
complete samples of stellar clusters in a disk galaxy to date.
We present the Year 1 cluster catalog that includes 600 high-
quality objects, representing the first installment of a 2500
object sample expected from the full dataset. HST's exquisite
resolution and sensitivity has allowed us to identify hundreds
of new clusters that push well into the low luminosity regime,
down to M(V) -2. We present luminosity functions and structural
parameters of the Year 1 clusters, compare our results to
previous cluster studies in M31, and highlight interesting
science results made possible by this incredible dataset.},
