 abstract = {The PHAT survey is expected to find more than 2000 clusters in M31,
creating one of the largest and most complete samples of
clusters known in any galaxy. The six-filter PHAT imaging
enables studies of clusters' integrated properties and their
resolved stellar content. We detect clusters with masses as low
as Ã¥isebox-0.5ex~100 Msun, orders of magnitude
lower than previous extragalactic studies and ground-based
studies of M31. We detail our efforts to identify and quantify
the completeness of the PHAT cluster sample, and to determine
cluster ages, masses and structural parameters. We present
results using our initial cluster sample to understand the
efficiency of star cluster formation, the cluster mass function,
and the dissolution of clusters.},
