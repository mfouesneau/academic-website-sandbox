abstract: "The PHAT survey is expected to find more than 2000 clusters in M31, creating one of the largest and most complete samples of clusters known in any galaxy. The six-filter PHAT imaging enables studies of clusters' integrated properties and their resolved stellar content. We detect clusters with masses as low as Ã¥isebox-0.5ex~100 Msun, orders of magnitude lower than previous extragalactic studies and ground-based studies of M31. We detail our efforts to identify and quantify the completeness of the PHAT cluster sample, and to determine cluster ages, masses and structural parameters. We present results using our initial cluster sample to understand the efficiency of star cluster formation, the cluster mass function, and the dissolution of clusters."
