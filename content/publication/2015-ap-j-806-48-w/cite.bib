 abstract = {We have identified a major global enhancement of star formation in the
inner M31 disk that occurred between 2-4 Gyr ago, producing
\ensuremathâˆ¼60% of the stellar mass formed in the past 5
Gyr. The presence of this episode in the inner disk was
discovered by modeling the optical resolved star color-magnitude
diagrams of low extinction regions in the main disk of M31 (3 <
R < 20 kpc) as part of the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda
Treasury. This measurement confirms and extends recent
measurements of a widespread star formation enhancement of
similar age in the outer disk, suggesting that this burst was
both massive and global. Following the galaxy-wide burst, the
star formation rate of M31 has significantly declined. We
briefly discuss possible causes for these features of the M31
evolutionary history, including interactions with M32, M33,
and/or a merger.},
