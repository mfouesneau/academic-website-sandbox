 abstract = {The apparent age and mass of a stellar cluster can be strongly affected
by stochastic sampling of the stellar initial mass function
(IMF), when inferred from the integrated color of low-mass
clusters (lsim10$^4$ M $_\ensuremathødot$). We use
simulated star clusters to show that these effects are minimized
when the brightest, rapidly evolving stars in a cluster can be
resolved, and the light of the fainter, more numerous unresolved
stars can be analyzed separately. When comparing the light from
the less luminous cluster members to models of unresolved light,
more accurate age estimates can be obtained than when analyzing
the integrated light from the entire cluster under the
assumption that the IMF is fully populated. We show the success
of this technique first using simulated clusters, and then with
a stellar cluster in M31. This method represents one way of
accounting for the discrete, stochastic sampling of the stellar
IMF in less massive clusters and can be leveraged in studies of
clusters throughout the Local Group and other nearby galaxies.
