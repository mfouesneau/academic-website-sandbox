 abstract = {We present a map of the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of dust in
the Orion complex. Orion is the closest site of high-mass star
formation, making it an excellent laboratory for studying the
interstellar medium and star formation. We use data from the
Gaia-TGAS catalogue combined with photometry from 2MASS and WISE
to get the distances and extinctions of individual stars in the
vicinity of the Orion complex. We adopt the non-parametric
method of Rezaei Kh. et al. (2017) to infer the probability
distribution function of the dust densities at arbitrary points
throughout the region. We map the dust distribution towards
different parts of the Orion complex and find the distance and
depth of the cloud compatible with other recent works which show
the ability of the method to be applicable on the local
molecular clouds to map their 3D dust distribution. We also
demonstrate the danger of only using colours of stars to derive
their extinctions without considering further physical
constraints like the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD).},
