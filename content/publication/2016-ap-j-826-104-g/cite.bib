 abstract = {We present the Bayesian Extinction And Stellar Tool (BEAST), a
probabilistic approach to modeling the dust extinguished
photometric spectral energy distribution of an individual star
while accounting for observational uncertainties common to large
resolved star surveys. Given a set of photometric measurements
and an observational uncertainty model, the BEAST infers the
physical properties of the stellar source using stellar
evolution and atmosphere models and constrains the line of sight
extinction using a newly developed mixture model that
encompasses the full range of dust extinction curves seen in the
Local Group. The BEAST is specifically formulated for use with
large multi-band surveys of resolved stellar populations. Our
approach accounts for measurement uncertainties and any
covariance between them due to stellar crowding (both systematic
biases and uncertainties in the bias) and absolute flux
calibration, thereby incorporating the full information content
of the measurement. We illustrate the accuracy and precision
possible with the BEAST using data from the Panchromatic Hubble
Andromeda Treasury. While the BEAST has been developed for this
survey, it can be easily applied to similar existing and planned
resolved star surveys. \\Based on
