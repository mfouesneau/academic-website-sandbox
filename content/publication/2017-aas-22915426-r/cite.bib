 abstract = {Stellar evolution models are fundamental to nearly all studies in
astrophysics. They are used to interpret spectral energy
distributions of distant galaxies, to derive the star formation
histories of nearby galaxies, and to understand fundamental
parameters of exoplanets. Despite the success in using stellar
evolution models, some important aspects of stellar evolution
remain poorly constrained and their uncertainties rarely
addressed. We present results using archival Hubble Space
Telescope observations of 10 stellar clusters in the Magellanic
Clouds to simultaneously constrain the values and uncertainties
of the strength of core convective overshooting, metallicity,
interstellar extinction, cluster distance, binary fraction, and
age.},
