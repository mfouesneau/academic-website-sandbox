 abstract = {Using the astrometry and integrated photometry from the Gaia Early Data
Release 3, we map the density variations in the distribution of
young upper main sequence (UMS) stars, open clusters, and
classical Cepheids in the Galactic disc within several
kiloparsecs of the Sun. We derive maps of relative over- and
under-dense regions for UMS stars in the Galactic disc using
both bivariate kernel density estimators and wavelet
transformations. The resulting overdensity maps exhibit large-
scale arches that extend in a clumpy but coherent way over the
entire sampled volume, indicating the location of the spiral arm
segments in the vicinity of the Sun. Peaks in the UMS
overdensity are well matched by the distribution of young and
intrinsically bright open clusters. By applying a wavelet
transformation to a sample of classical Cepheids, we find that
their overdensities possibly extend the spiral arm segments on a
larger scale (≃10 kpc from the Sun). While the resulting map
based on the UMS sample is generally consistent with previous
models of the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm, the geometry of the
arms in the III quadrant (galactic longitudes 180° <
l < 270°) differs significantly from that suggested
by many previous models. In particular, we find that our maps
favour a larger pitch angle for the Perseus arm, and that the
Local Arm extends into the III quadrant at least 4 kpc past the
position of the Sun, giving it a total length of at least 8 kpc.
