 abstract = {First, we select SNRs from catalogs which overlap with HST fields in M31
and M33. We limited our search to fields observed with the ACS
and WFPC-2 instruments, as the optical CMDs tend to be deeper
and offer the best SFH constraints. For M31, we combine three
SNR catalogs to select targets from: Braun & Walterbos
(1993A&AS...98..327B); Magnier et al. (1995, J/A+AS/114/215);
Williams et al. (1995BAAS...27..883W). All three catalogs make
use of [S II]-to-H\ensuremathα ratios to identify SNR.
Our M33 SNR catalog comes from Long et al. (2010,
J/ApJS/187/495), who selected SNRs using both [S
II]-to-H\ensuremathα ratios and X-ray observations.
Long et al. (2010, J/ApJS/187/495) incorporated all previous SNR
catalogs from the literature in their analysis. As mentioned in
Section 1, all new M31 data analyzed in this work come from
newly available PHAT data sets and therefore have uniform
filters and exposure times, while the M33 data comes from
various archival data sets coincident with SNR.
