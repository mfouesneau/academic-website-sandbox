abstract: "First, we select SNRs from catalogs which overlap with HST fields in M31 and M33. We limited our search to fields observed with the ACS and WFPC-2 instruments, as the optical CMDs tend to be deeper and offer the best SFH constraints. For M31, we combine three SNR catalogs to select targets from: Braun & Walterbos (1993A&AS...98..327B); Magnier et al. (1995, J/A+AS/114/215); Williams et al. (1995BAAS...27..883W). All three catalogs make use of [S II]-to-Hensuremathα ratios to identify SNR. Our M33 SNR catalog comes from Long et al. (2010, J/ApJS/187/495), who selected SNRs using both [S II]-to-Hensuremathα ratios and X-ray observations. Long et al. (2010, J/ApJS/187/495) incorporated all previous SNR catalogs from the literature in their analysis. As mentioned in Section 1, all new M31 data analyzed in this work come from newly available PHAT data sets and therefore have uniform filters and exposure times, while the M33 data comes from various archival data sets coincident with SNR.
