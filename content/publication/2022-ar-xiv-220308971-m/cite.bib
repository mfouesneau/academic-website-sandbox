 abstract = {White dwarfs (WDs) offer unrealized potential in solving two problems in
astrophysics: stellar age accuracy and precision. WD cooling
ages can be inferred from surface temperatures and radii, which
can be constrained with precision by high quality photometry and
parallaxes. Accurate and precise Gaia parallaxes along with
photometric surveys provide information to derive cooling and
total ages for vast numbers of WDs. Here we analyse 1372 WDs
found in wide binaries with MS companions, and report on the
cooling and total age precision attainable in these WD+MS
systems. The total age of a WD can be further constrained if its
original metallicity is known, because the main-sequence (MS)
progenitor lifetime depends on metallicity at fixed mass, yet
metallicity is unavailable via spectroscopy of the WD. We show
that incorporating spectroscopic metallicity constraints from 38
wide binary MS companions substantially decreases internal
uncertainties in WD total ages compared to a uniform constraint.
Averaged over the 38 stars in our sample, the total (internal)
age uncertainty improves from 21.04% to 16.77% when
incorporating the spectroscopic constraint. Higher mass WDs
yield better total age precision; for 8 WDs with zero age main
sequence masses $≥$ 2.0 solar masses, the mean uncertainty in
total ages improves from 8.61% to 4.54% when incorporating
spectroscopic metallicities. We find that it is often possible
to achieve 5% total age precision for WDs with progenitor
masses above 2.0 solar masses if parallaxes with $łeq$ 1%
precision and Pan-STARRS $g, r$, and $i$ photometry with $łeq$
0.01 mag precision are available.},
