 abstract = {Recent studies suggest that starburst dwarf galaxies played an important
role in the early universe. Because these galaxies dominate by
number, their leaked ionizing photons are likely main
contributors to the reionization of the intergalactic medium
(IGM). However, the complex structure of the interstellar medium
(ISM) even at the pc scale makes it hard to predict the escape
fraction of ionizing photons from high-redshift galaxies
accurately. Analogues to their high-redshift counterparts,
nearby starburst dwarf galaxies provide excellent laboratories
to study the impact of star formation on the surrounding ISM and
IGM in detail. Thanks to its proximity, the dwarf galaxy, NGC
4214, has been imaged with the high-resolution of WFC3 on HST
from the near-UV to the near-IR (F225W, F336W, F438W, F814W,
F110W, and F160W). These observations yielded measurements of
the broad spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for
\ensuremath∼36,000 resolved stars within this galaxy. We
developed a probabilistic tool (Bayesian Extinction and Stellar
Tool, a.k.a. BEAST) to simultaneously infer from their SEDs the
stellar properties of individual stars and the intervening dust
properties along the line of sight to each star. With the aid of
BEAST, we are able to infer the intrinsic ionizing flux produced
by individual stars. By comparing this intrinsic ionizing flux
with the flux that is used to ionize the ISM in the galaxy,
derived based on the extinction-corrected H\ensuremathα
emission, we can estimate the escape fraction and its local
variation within the galaxy. Our preliminary results show that
the global UV leakage of NGC 4214 is \ensuremath∼10%.},
