 abstract = {Gaia DR2 offers us a first glimpse at the most detailed view of the
dynamics of field star populations in our Galaxy. However;
knowledge of the stellar properties of these populations is
critical to understanding fully the Milky-Way's formation and
evolution. We present an all-sky uniformly derived catalog of
stellar astrophysical parameters for hundreds of millions of
stars implementing our data processing of the next Gaia data
release. \\As the DR3 BP/RP spectra
are not yet available; we combined measurements of Gaia
integrated photometry with GALEX; 2MASS; and WISE photometry;
where available as an alternative to cover a large wavelength
range. We obtain the posterior probability distribution of
stellar properties such as age; mass; temperature; bolometric
luminosity; distance; and dust extinction by fitting these sets
of SEDs with evolutionary models; taking advantage of the GDR2
parallaxes to uniquely link atmospheric parameters to absolute
bolometric luminosities. \\This
catalog bridges the gap between the content of GDR2 and the
future GDR3 which will provide stellar parameters using Gaia
data alone. This represents a key first step to anchor all
current and future spectroscopic surveys to a common ground and
provide us with the most comprehensive view of our Galaxy.},
