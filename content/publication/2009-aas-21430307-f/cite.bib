 abstract = {Since the beginning of its mission in 2003, the Spitzer Space Telescope
has spent two to three hours of every IRAC instrument campaign
observing a particularly dark field located a few degrees from
the north galactic pole: the IRAC Dark Calibration Field. The
resulting survey is now the deepest integration from 3.5 to 8.0
microns. Its unique temporal depth (109 epochs over a span of
2000 days so far) provides a means of closely monitoring the
variability of 15,000 stars and galaxies in the mid-infrared. We
have photometered all 109 epochs in all four IRAC bands. Based
on these 4x15,000 light-curves, we detected 30 IR-variable
galaxies confirming previous observations (Hund et al., 2007)
and 20 long-period variability stars (Fouesneau et al., 2009 in
prep.). In this contribution, we review the multi-epoch analysis
and related issues, especially the light-curve periodicity
analysis. We present variable candidates, already confirmed by
additional observations at other wavelengths. Finally, we
discuss the outcomes and perspectives of such a deep survey.},
