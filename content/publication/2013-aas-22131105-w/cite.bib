 abstract = {I will present results from our ongoing study of the high mass stellar
initial mass function (IMF) in M31. I will review the
probabilistic technique for inferring the present day mass
function (MF) of a resolved young star cluster that avoids many
of challenges associated traditional IMF studies (e.g., binning
of data, observational completeness), and show how this
technique can robustly provide constraints on the high mass IMF.
I will show preliminary MF measurements for select young
clusters observed with PHAT, and discuss progress toward a
secure high mass IMF determination in M31 using
Ã¥isebox-0.5ex~ 1000 young resolved star
clusters.},
