abstract: "I will present results from our ongoing study of the high mass stellar initial mass function (IMF) in M31. I will review the probabilistic technique for inferring the present day mass function (MF) of a resolved young star cluster that avoids many of challenges associated traditional IMF studies (e.g., binning of data, observational completeness), and show how this technique can robustly provide constraints on the high mass IMF. I will show preliminary MF measurements for select young clusters observed with PHAT, and discuss progress toward a secure high mass IMF determination in M31 using Ã¥isebox-0.5ex~ 1000 young resolved star clusters."
