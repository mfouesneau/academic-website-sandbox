 abstract = {The APOKASC project is the spectroscopic follow-up by APOGEE (Majewski
et al. 2015, in prep., as part of the third phase of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey, SDSS-III; Eisenstein et al.,
2011AJ....142...72E) of stars with asteroseismology data from
the Kepler Asteroseismic Science Consortium (KASC). The first
version of the APOKASC catalogue (Pinsonneault et al., 2014,
Cat. J/ApJS/215/19) contains seismic and spectroscopic
measurements for 1989 giants, with the spectroscopic information
corresponding to APOGEE's Data Release 10 (DR10; Ahn et al.,
2014ApJS..211...17A). In this work, we keep the same original
sample of 1989 stars and their seismic parameters, but update
their Teff and abundances to DR12 values (Alam et al.,
2015ApJS..219...12A; Holtzman et al., 2015AJ....150..148H).
