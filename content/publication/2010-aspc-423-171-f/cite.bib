 abstract = {The integrated spectro-photometric properties of star clusters are
subject to large cluster-to-cluster variations. They are
distributed in non-trivial ways around the average properties
predicted by standard population synthesis models. This results
from the stochastic mass distribution of the finite (small)
number of luminous stars in each cluster, stars which may be
either particularly blue or particularly red. The color
distributions are broad and usually far from Gaussian,
especially for young and intermediate age clusters, as found in
interacting galaxies. When photometric measurements of clusters
are used to estimate ages and masses in conjunction with
standard models, biases are to be expected. We present a
Bayesian approach that explicitly accounts for stochasticity
when estimating ages and masses of star clusters that cannot be
resolved into stars. Based on Monte-Carlo simulations, we are
starting to explore the probability distributions of star
cluster properties obtained given a set of multi-wavelength
photometric data.},
