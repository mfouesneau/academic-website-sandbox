 abstract = {We present a sample of 11 M31 Cepheids in stellar clusters, derived from
the overlap of the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury
cluster catalog and the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) disk Cepheid catalog.
After identifying the PS1 Cepheids in the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) catalog, we calibrate the PS1 mean magnitudes using the
higher resolution HST photometry, revealing up to 1 mag offsets
due to crowding effects in the ground-based catalog. We measure
ages of the clusters by performing single-age stellar population
fits to their color-magnitude diagrams excluding their Cepheids.
From these cluster age measurements, we derive an empirical
period-age relation which agrees well with the existing
literature values. By confirming this relation for M31 Cepheids,
we justify its application in high-precision pointwise age
estimation across M31.},
