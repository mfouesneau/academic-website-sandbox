 abstract = {We use the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury survey data set to
perform spatially resolved measurements of star cluster
formation efficiency (\ensuremathΓ), the fraction of
stellar mass formed in long-lived star clusters. We use robust
star formation history and cluster parameter constraints,
obtained through color-magnitude diagram analysis of resolved
stellar populations, to study Andromeda\textquoterights
cluster and field populations over the last
\ensuremath∼300 Myr. We measure \ensuremathΓ of
4%-8% for young, 10-100 Myr-old populations in M31. We find
that cluster formation efficiency varies systematically across
the M31 disk, consistent with variations in mid-plane pressure.
These \ensuremathΓ measurements expand the range of
well-studied galactic environments, providing precise
constraints in an H I-dominated, low-intensity star formation
environment. Spatially resolved results from M31 are broadly
consistent with previous trends observed on galaxy-integrated
scales, where \ensuremathΓ increases with increasing
star formation rate surface density
(\ensuremathΣ$_SFR$). However, we can explain
observed scatter in the relation and attain better agreement
between observations and theoretical models if we account for
environmental variations in gas depletion time
(\ensuremathτ $_dep$) when modeling
\ensuremathΓ, accounting for the qualitative shift in
star formation behavior when transitioning from a
H$_2$-dominated to a H I-dominated interstellar medium. We
also demonstrate that \ensuremathΓ measurements in high
\ensuremathΣ$_SFR$ starburst systems are well-
explained by \ensuremathτ $_dep$-dependent fiducial
\ensuremathΓ models.},
