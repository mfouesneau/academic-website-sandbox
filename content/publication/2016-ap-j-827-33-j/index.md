abstract: "We use the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury survey data set to perform spatially resolved measurements of star cluster formation efficiency (ensuremathΓ), the fraction of stellar mass formed in long-lived star clusters. We use robust star formation history and cluster parameter constraints, obtained through color-magnitude diagram analysis of resolved stellar populations, to study Andromedatextquoterights cluster and field populations over the last ensuremath∼300 Myr. We measure ensuremathΓ of 4%-8% for young, 10-100 Myr-old populations in M31. We find that cluster formation efficiency varies systematically across the M31 disk, consistent with variations in mid-plane pressure. These ensuremathΓ measurements expand the range of well-studied galactic environments, providing precise constraints in an H I-dominated, low-intensity star formation environment. Spatially resolved results from M31 are broadly consistent with previous trends observed on galaxy-integrated scales, where ensuremathΓ increases with increasing star formation rate surface density (ensuremathΣ$_SFR$). However, we can explain observed scatter in the relation and attain better agreement between observations and theoretical models if we account for environmental variations in gas depletion time (ensuremathτ $_dep$) when modeling ensuremathΓ, accounting for the qualitative shift in star formation behavior when transitioning from a H$_2$-dominated to a H I-dominated interstellar medium. We also demonstrate that ensuremathΓ measurements in high ensuremathΣ$_SFR$ starburst systems are well- explained by ensuremathτ $_dep$-dependent fiducial ensuremathΓ models."
