 abstract = {We explore to what extent stars within Galactic disk open clusters
resemble each other in the high-dimensional space of their
photospheric element abundances and contrast this with pairs of
field stars. Our analysis is based on abundances for 20
elements, homogeneously derived from APOGEE spectra (with
carefully quantified uncertainties of typically 0.03 dex). We
consider 90 red giant stars in seven open clusters and find that
most stars within a cluster have abundances in most elements
that are indistinguishable (in a \\ensuremathχ
\$^2$-sense) from those of the other members, as expected for
stellar birth siblings. An analogous analysis among pairs of >
1000 field stars shows that highly significant abundance
differences in the 20 dimensional space can be established for
the vast majority of these pairs, and that the APOGEE-based
abundance measurements have high discriminating power. However,
pairs of field stars whose abundances are indistinguishable even
at 0.03 dex precision exist: \ensuremath∼0.3% of all
field star pairs and \ensuremath∼1.0% of field star
pairs at the same (solar) metallicity [Fe/H] = 0
\ensuremath± 0.02. Most of these pairs are presumably not
birth siblings from the same cluster, but rather
doppelgängers. Our analysis implies that
“chemical tagging” in the
strict sense, identifying birth siblings for typical disk stars
through their abundance similarity alone, will not work with
such data. However, our approach shows that abundances have
extremely valuable information for probabilistic chemo-orbital
modeling, and combined with velocities, we have identified new
cluster members from the field.},
