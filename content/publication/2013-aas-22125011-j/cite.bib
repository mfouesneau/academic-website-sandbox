 abstract = {The Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) is a multicycle Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) program that has imaged nearly 1/3 of the
star forming disk of M31 at high spatial resolution in 6
wavelengths ranging from the UV to the NIR. This high-quality
data set allows for a detailed study of the galaxy's star
clusters, ranging from massive 106̂ Msolar globular clusters to
objects equivalent to Galactic open clusters with masses of
<10\ ̂Msolar. The Andromeda Project, one of the latest
additions to the Zooniverse collection of citizen science
projects, builds on the success of our Year 1 by-eye cluster
search and enlists the public to help create one of the largest
catalog of star clusters available for any galaxy. Using an
interactive website, volunteers scour HST images to identify
clusters, background galaxies, and image artifacts. By
incorporating synthetic star clusters into the search, we will
also obtain the first robust measurement of completeness for a
by-eye cluster catalog. The detailed knowledge of catalog
completeness is essential to assessing and interpreting age and
mass distributions of Andromeda's cluster population. We present
the website and compare our initial expert-derived approach with
the use of citizen scientists.},
