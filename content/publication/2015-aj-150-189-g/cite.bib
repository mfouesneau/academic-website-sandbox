 abstract = {We present a study of spatial variations in the metallicity of old red
giant branch stars in the Andromeda galaxy. Photometric
metallicity estimates are derived by interpolating isochrones
for over seven million stars in the Panchromatic Hubble
Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey. This is the first systematic
study of stellar metallicities over the inner 20 kpc of
Andromeda\textquoterights galactic disk. We see a clear
metallicity gradient of -0.020 \ensuremath± 0.004 dex
kpc$^-1$ from \ensuremath∼4-20 kpc assuming a constant
red giant branch age. This metallicity gradient is derived after
correcting for the effects of photometric bias and completeness
and dust extinction, and is quite insensitive to these effects.
The unknown age gradient in M31's disk creates the dominant
systematic uncertainty in our derived metallicity gradient.
However, spectroscopic analyses of galaxies similar to M31 show
that they typically have small age gradients that make this
systematic error comparable to the 1\ensuremathσ error
on our metallicity gradient measurement. In addition to the
metallicity gradient, we observe an asymmetric local enhancement
in metallicity at radii of 3-6 kpc that appears to be associated
with Andromeda\textquoterights elongated bar. This same region
also appears to have an enhanced stellar density and velocity
dispersion.},
