 abstract = {Stellar physical and dynamical properties are essential knowledge to
understanding the structure, formation, and evolution of our
Galaxy. We produced an all-sky uniformly derived catalog of
stellar astrophysical parameters (APs; age, mass, temperature,
bolometric luminosity, distance, dust extinction) to give
insight into the physical properties of Milky-Way stars.
Exploiting the power of multi-wavelength and multi-survey
observations from Gaia DR2 parallaxes and integrated photometry
along with 2MASS and AllWISE photometry, we introduce an all-sky
uniformly derived catalog of stellar astrophysical parameters,
including dust extinction (A0) and average grain size (R0) along
the line of sight, for 123,097,070 stars. In contrast with
previous works, we do not use a Galactic model as prior in our
analysis. We validate our results against other literature
(e.g., benchmark stars, interferometry, Bayestar, StarHorse).
The limited optical information in the Gaia photometric bands or
the lack of ultraviolet or spectroscopic information renders the
chemistry inference prior dominated. We demonstrate that Gaia
parallaxes bring sufficient leverage to explore the detailed
structures of the interstellar medium in our Milky Way. In Gaia
DR3, we will obtain the dispersed optical light information to
break through some limitations of this analysis, allowing us to
infer stellar chemistry in particular. Gaia promises us data to
construct the most detailed view of the chemo-dynamics of field
star populations in our Galaxy. Our catalog is available from
