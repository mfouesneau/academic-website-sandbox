abstract: "Stellar physical and dynamical properties are essential knowledge to understanding the structure, formation, and evolution of our Galaxy. We produced an all-sky uniformly derived catalog of stellar astrophysical parameters (APs; age, mass, temperature, bolometric luminosity, distance, dust extinction) to give insight into the physical properties of Milky-Way stars. Exploiting the power of multi-wavelength and multi-survey observations from Gaia DR2 parallaxes and integrated photometry along with 2MASS and AllWISE photometry, we introduce an all-sky uniformly derived catalog of stellar astrophysical parameters, including dust extinction (A0) and average grain size (R0) along the line of sight, for 123,097,070 stars. In contrast with previous works, we do not use a Galactic model as prior in our analysis. We validate our results against other literature (e.g., benchmark stars, interferometry, Bayestar, StarHorse). The limited optical information in the Gaia photometric bands or the lack of ultraviolet or spectroscopic information renders the chemistry inference prior dominated. We demonstrate that Gaia parallaxes bring sufficient leverage to explore the detailed structures of the interstellar medium in our Milky Way. In Gaia DR3, we will obtain the dispersed optical light information to break through some limitations of this analysis, allowing us to infer stellar chemistry in particular. Gaia promises us data to construct the most detailed view of the chemo-dynamics of field star populations in our Galaxy. Our catalog is available from GAVO at http://dc.g-vo.org/tableinfo/gdr2ap.main (soon Gaia Archive and VizieR)"
