 abstract = {We study the relationship between the field star formation and cluster
formation properties in a large sample of nearby dwarf galaxies.
We use optical data from the Hubble Space Telescope and from
ground-based telescopes to derive the ages and masses of the
young (t $_age$ <Ã¥isebox-0.5ex~ 100 Myr)
cluster sample. Our data provide the first constraints on two
proposed relationships between the star formation rate (SFR) of
galaxies and the properties of their cluster systems in the low
SFR regime. The data show broad agreement with these
relationships, but significant galaxy-to-galaxy scatter exists.
In part, this scatter can be accounted for by simulating the
small number of clusters detected from stochastically sampling
the cluster mass function. However, this stochasticity does not
fully account for the observed scatter in our data, suggesting
that there may be true variations in the fraction of stars
formed in clusters in dwarf galaxies. Comparison of the cluster
formation and the brightest cluster in our sample galaxies also
provide constraints on cluster destruction models.},
