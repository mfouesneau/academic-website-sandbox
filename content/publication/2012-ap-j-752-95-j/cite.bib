 abstract = {The Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey is an ongoing
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) multi-cycle program to obtain high
spatial resolution imaging of one-third of the M31 disk at
ultraviolet through near-infrared wavelengths. In this paper, we
present the first installment of the PHAT stellar cluster
catalog. When completed, the PHAT cluster catalog will be among
the largest and most comprehensive surveys of resolved star
clusters in any galaxy. The exquisite spatial resolution
achieved with HST has allowed us to identify hundreds of new
clusters that were previously inaccessible with existing ground-
based surveys. We identify 601 clusters in the Year 1 sample,
representing more than a factor of four increase over previous
catalogs within the current survey area (390 arcmin$^2$). This
work presents results derived from the first
åisebox-0.5ex~25% of the survey data; we
estimate that the final sample will include
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~2500 clusters. For the Year 1
objects, we present a catalog with positions, radii, and six-
band integrated photometry. Along with a general
characterization of the cluster luminosities and colors, we
discuss the cluster luminosity function, the cluster size
distributions, and highlight a number of individually
interesting clusters found in the Year 1 search.},
