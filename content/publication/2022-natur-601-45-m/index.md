abstract: "Stellar ejecta gradually enrich the gas out of which subsequent stars form, making the least chemically enriched stellar systems direct fossils of structures formed in the early Universe$^1$. Although a few hundred stars with metal content below 1,000th of the solar iron content are known in the Galaxy$^2-4$, none of them inhabit globular clusters, some of the oldest known stellar structures. These show metal content of at least approximately 0.2% of the solar metallicity ([Fe /H ]ensuremathgtrsimensuremath-2.7 )?. This metallicity floor appears universal$^5,6$, and it has been proposed that protogalaxies that merged into the galaxies we observe today were simply not massive enough to form clusters that survived to the present day$^7$. Here we report observations of a stellar stream, C-19, whose metallicity is less than 0.05% of the solar metallicity ([F e / H ]=ensuremath-3.38 ensuremath±0.06 (s t a t i s t i c a l )ensuremath±0.20 (s y s t e m a t i c ))?. The low metallicity dispersion and the chemical abundances of the C-19 stars show that this stream is the tidal remnant of the most metal-poor globular cluster ever discovered, and is significantly below the purported metallicity floor: clusters with significantly lower metallicities than observed today existed in the past and contributed their stars to the Milky Way halo."
