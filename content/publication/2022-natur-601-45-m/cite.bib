 abstract = {Stellar ejecta gradually enrich the gas out of which subsequent stars
form, making the least chemically enriched stellar systems
direct fossils of structures formed in the early Universe$^1$.
Although a few hundred stars with metal content below 1,000th of
the solar iron content are known in the Galaxy$^2-4$, none of
them inhabit globular clusters, some of the oldest known stellar
structures. These show metal content of at least approximately
0.2% of the solar metallicity ([Fe /H
]\ensuremath\gtrsim\ensuremath-2.7 )?. This metallicity
floor appears universal$^5,6$, and it has been proposed that
protogalaxies that merged into the galaxies we observe today
were simply not massive enough to form clusters that survived to
the present day$^7$. Here we report observations of a stellar
stream, C-19, whose metallicity is less than 0.05% of the solar
metallicity ([F e / H ]=\ensuremath-3.38
\ensuremath±0.06 (s t a t i s t i c a l
)\ensuremath±0.20 (s y s t e m a t i c ))?. The low
metallicity dispersion and the chemical abundances of the C-19
stars show that this stream is the tidal remnant of the most
metal-poor globular cluster ever discovered, and is
significantly below the purported metallicity floor: clusters
with significantly lower metallicities than observed today
existed in the past and contributed their stars to the Milky Way
halo.},
