 abstract = {The Pristine survey is a narrow-band, photometric survey focused around
the wavelength region of the Ca II H&K absorption lines,
designed to efficiently search for extremely metal-poor stars.
In this work, we use the first results of a medium-resolution
spectroscopic follow-up to refine the selection criteria for
finding extremely metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] \ensuremathłeq
-3.0) in the Pristine survey. We consider methods by which stars
can be selected from available broad-band and infrared
photometry plus the additional Pristine narrow-band photometry.
The sample consists of 205 stars in the magnitude range 14 < V <
18. Applying the photometric selection criteria cuts the sample
down to 149 stars, and from these we report a success rate of 70
per cent for finding stars with [Fe/H] \ensuremathłeq -2.5
and 22 per cent for finding stars with [Fe/H]
\ensuremathłeq -3.0. These statistics compare favourably
with other surveys that search for extremely metal-poor stars,
namely an improvement by a factor of \ensuremath∼4 - 5
for recovering stars with [Fe/H] \ensuremathłeq -3.0. In
addition, Pristine covers a fainter magnitude range than its
predecessors and can thus probe deeper into the Galactic halo.},
