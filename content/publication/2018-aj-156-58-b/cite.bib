 abstract = {For the vast majority of stars in the second Gaia data release, reliable
distances cannot be obtained by inverting the parallax. A
correct inference procedure must instead be used to account for
the nonlinearity of the transformation and the asymmetry of the
resulting probability distribution. Here, we infer distances to
essentially all 1.33 billion stars with parallaxes published in
the second Gaia data release. This is done using a weak distance
prior that varies smoothly as a function of Galactic longitude
and latitude according to a Galaxy model. The irreducible
uncertainty in the distance estimate is characterized by the
lower and upper bounds of an asymmetric confidence interval.
Although more precise distances can be estimated for a subset of
the stars using additional data (such as photometry), our goal
is to provide purely geometric distance estimates, independent
of assumptions about the physical properties of, or interstellar
extinction toward, individual stars. We analyze the
characteristics of the catalog and validate it using clusters.
