 abstract = {Observational tests of stellar and Galactic chemical evolution call for
the joint knowledge of a star's physical parameters, detailed
element abundances, and precise age. For cool main-sequence (MS)
stars the abundances of many elements can be measured from
spectroscopy, but ages are very hard to determine. The situation
is different if the MS star has a white dwarf (WD) companion and
a known distance, as the age of such a binary system can then be
determined precisely from the photometric properties of the
cooling WD. As a pilot study for obtaining precise age
determinations of field MS stars, we identify nearly 100
candidates for such wide binary systems: a faint WD whose Gaia-
PS1-SDSS (GPS1) proper motion (Tian+ 2017, I/343) matches that
of a brighter MS star in Gaia/TGAS (Gaia Collaboration 2016,
I/337) with a good parallax
(\ensuremathσ$_\rho\$/\rho\=<0.05). We model the
WD's multi-band photometry with the BASE-9 code using this
precise distance (assumed to be common for the pair) and infer
ages for each binary system. The resulting age estimates are
precise to =<10% (=<20%) for 42 (67) MS-WD systems. Our
analysis more than doubles the number of MS-WD systems with
precise distances known to date, and it boosts the number of
such systems with precise age determination by an order of
magnitude. With the advent of the Gaia DR2 (Gaia Collaboration,
2018, I/345) data, this approach will be applicable to a far
larger sample, providing ages for many MS stars (that can yield
detailed abundances for over 20 elements), especially in the age
range of 2-8Gyr, where there are only few known star clusters.
