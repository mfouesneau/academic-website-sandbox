 abstract = {The extended main-sequence turn offs (eMSTOs) of several young to
intermediate age clusters are examined in the Magellanic Clouds
and the Milky Way. We explore the effects of extended star
formation (eSF) and a range of stellar rotation rates on the
behavior of the color-magnitude diagram, paying particular
attention to the MSTO. We create synthetic stellar populations
based on MESA stellar models to simulate observed Hubble Space
Telescope and Gaia star cluster data. We model the effect of
rotation as a nonparametric distribution, allowing for maximum
flexibility. In our models the slow rotators comprise the
blueward, and fast rotators the redward portion of the eMSTO. We
simulate data under three scenarios: nonrotating eSF, a range of
rotation rates with a single age, and a combination of age and
rotation effects. We find that two of the five clusters (the
youngest and oldest) favor an age spread, but these also achieve
the overall worst fits of all clusters. The other three clusters
show comparable statistical evidence between rotation and an age
spread. In all five cases, a rotation-rate distribution alone is
capable of qualitatively matching the observed eMSTO structure.
In future work, we aim to compare our predicted
V\sin i with observations in order to better
constrain the physics related to stellar rotation.},
