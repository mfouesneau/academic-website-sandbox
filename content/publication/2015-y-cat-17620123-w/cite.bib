 abstract = {We present a probabilistic approach for inferring the parameters of the
present-day power-law stellar mass function (MF) of a resolved
young star cluster. This technique (1) fully exploits the
information content of a given data set; (2) can account for
observational uncertainties in a straightforward way; (3)
assigns meaningful uncertainties to the inferred parameters; (4)
avoids the pitfalls associated with binning data; and (5) can be
applied to virtually any resolved young cluster, laying the
groundwork for a systematic study of the high-mass stellar MF
(M>åisebox-0.5ex~1M$_̇o$). Using
simulated clusters and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling of the
probability distribution functions, we show that estimates of
the MF slope, \ensuremathα, are unbiased and that the
uncertainty, \ensuremathΔ\ensuremathα, depends
primarily on the number of observed stars and on the range of
stellar masses they span, assuming that the uncertainties on
individual masses and the completeness are both well
characterized. Using idealized mock data, we compute the
theoretical precision, i.e., lower limits, on
\ensuremathα, and provide an analytic approximation for
\ensuremathΔ\ensuremathα as a function of the
observed number of stars and mass range. Comparison with
literature studies shows that
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~3/4 of quoted uncertainties are
smaller than the theoretical lower limit. By correcting these
uncertainties to the theoretical lower limits, we find that the
literature studies yield <\ensuremathα>=2.46, with a
1\ensuremathσ dispersion of 0.35dex. The precision on
MF slope recovery in this paper are lower limits, as we do not
explicitly consider all possible sources of uncertainty,
including dynamical effects (e.g., mass segregation), unresolved
binaries, and non-coeval populations.
