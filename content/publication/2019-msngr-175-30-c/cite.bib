 abstract = {The mechanisms of the formation and evolution of the Milky Way are
encoded in the orbits, chemistry and ages of its stars. With the
4MOST MIlky way Disk And BuLgE Low-Resolution Survey (4MIDABLE-
LR) we aim to study kinematic and chemical substructures in the
Milky Way disc and bulge region with samples of unprecedented
size out to larger distances and greater precision than
conceivable with Gaia alone or any other ongoing or planned
survey. Gaia gives us the unique opportunity for target
selection based almost entirely on parallax and magnitude range,
hence increasing the efficiency in sampling larger Milky Way
volumes with well-defined and effective selection functions.},
