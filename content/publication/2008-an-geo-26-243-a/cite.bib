 abstract = {A new method for the automatic detection and tracking of solar filaments
is presented. The method addresses the problems facing existing
catalogs, such as the one developed recently in the frame of the
European Grid of Solar Observations (EGSO) project. In
particular, it takes into account the structural and temporal
evolution of filaments, differences in intensity as seen from
one observation to the next, and the possibility of sudden
disappearance followed by reappearance. In this study, the
problem of tracking is solved by plotting all detected filaments
during each solar rotation on a Carrington map and then by
applying region growing techniques on those plots. Using this
approach, the ``fixed'' positions of the envelopes in the
Carrington system can be deduced. This is followed by a backward
tracking of each filament by considering one full solar
rotation. The resulting shifted Carrington map then enables one
to follow any filament from one rotation to the next. Such maps
should prove valuable for studies of the role of filaments in
solar activity, notably coronal mass ejections (CMEs).},
