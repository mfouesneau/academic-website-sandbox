 abstract = {Statistical studies of cataloged object properties are central to
astrophysics. But one cannot model those objects' population
properties without the sample's selection function, the
quantitative understanding of which objects could have ended up
in such a catalog. As didactic introductions to this topic are
scarce in the astrophysical literature, we provide one here,
addressing the following questions: What is a selection
function? On what arguments q should it depend? Over what domain
must a selection function be defined? What simplifying
approximations can be made? And, how is a selection function
used in ``modeling''? We argue that volume-complete samples,
limited by the faintest objects, reflect a highly suboptimal
selection function, needlessly reducing the number of bright and
usually rare sample members. We illustrate these points by a
worked example: github.com/gaia-unlimited/WD-selection-function,
deriving the space density of white dwarfs (WDs) in the Galactic
neighborhood as a function of their luminosity and color,
\ensuremathΦ$_0$(M$_G$, (B - R)) in [mag$^-2$
pc$^-3$]. We construct a sample $ \mathcal C $ of 10$^5$
presumed WDs through straightforward selection cuts on the Gaia
EDR3 catalog in magnitude, color, and parallax, q = (G, (B - R),
\ensuremathǎrpi). We then combine a simple model for
\ensuremathΦ$_0$ with this selection function's $S_
\mathcal C (\boldsymbolq)$ effective survey volume to
estimate \ensuremathΦ$_0$(M$_G$, (B - R)) precisely
and robustly against the detailed choices for $S_ \mathcal C
(\boldsymbolq)$ . This resulting WD luminosity-color
function \ensuremathΦ$_0$(M$_G$, (B - R)) differs
dramatically from the initial number density distribution in the
luminosity-color plane: by orders of magnitude in density and by
four magnitudes in density peak location.},
