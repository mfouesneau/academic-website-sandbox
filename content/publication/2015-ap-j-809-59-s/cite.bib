 abstract = {The Ophiuchus stream is a recently discovered stellar tidal stream in
the Milky Way. We present high-quality spectroscopic data for 14
stream member stars obtained using the Keck and MMT telescopes.
We confirm the stream as a fast moving (v$_los$
\ensuremath∼ 290 km s$^-1$), kinematically cold group
(\\ensuremathσ
\$_\v$$_\los$\\\ensuremathłesssim 1 km s$^-1$)
of \ensuremathα-enhanced and metal-poor stars
([\ensuremathα/Fe] \ensuremath∼ 0.4 dex, [Fe/H]
\ensuremath∼ -2.0 dex). Using a probabilistic technique,
we model the stream simultaneously in line-of-sight velocity,
color-magnitude, coordinate, and proper motion space, and so
determine its distribution in 6D phase-space. We find that the
stream extends in distance from 7.5 to 9 kpc from the Sun; it is
50 times longer than wide, merely appearing highly foreshortened
in projection. The analysis of the stellar population contained
in the stream suggests that it is \ensuremath∼12 Gyr old,
and that its initial stellar mass was \ensuremath∼2
× 10$^4$ M$_\ensuremathødot$ (or at least
\ensuremath\gtrsim7 × 10$^3$
M$_\ensuremathødot$). Assuming a fiducial Milky Way
potential, we fit an orbit to the stream that matches the
observed phase-space distribution, except for some tension in
the proper motions: the stream has an orbital period of
\ensuremath∼350 Myr, and is on a fairly eccentric orbit
(e \ensuremath∼ 0.66) with a pericenter of
\ensuremath∼3.5 kpc and an apocenter of
\ensuremath∼17 kpc. The phase-space structure and stellar
population of the stream show that its progenitor must have been
a globular cluster that was disrupted only
\ensuremath∼240 Myr ago. We do not detect any significant
overdensity of stars along the stream that would indicate the
presence of a progenitor, and conclude that the stream is all
that is left of the progenitor.},
