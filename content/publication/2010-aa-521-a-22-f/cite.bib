 abstract = {Context. Star clusters are studied widely both as benchmarks for stellar
evolution models and in their own right. Cluster age
distributions and mass distributions within galaxies are probes
of star formation histories and of cluster formation and
disruption processes. The vast majority of clusters in the
Universe are small, and it is well known that the integrated
fluxes and colours of all but the most massive ones have broad
probability distributions, owing to small numbers of bright
stars. \ Aims: This paper goes beyond describing
predicted probability distributions to present results of the
analysis of cluster energy distributions in an explicitly
stochastic context. \ Methods: The method developed
is Bayesian. It provides posterior probability distributions in
the age-mass-extinction space, using multi-wavelength
photometric observations and a large collection of Monte-Carlo
simulations of clusters of finite stellar masses. The main
priors are the assumed intrinsic distributions of current mass
and current age for clusters in a galaxy. Both UBVI and UBVIK
data sets are considered, and the study conducted in this paper
is restricted to the solar metallicity. \ Results:
We first use the collection of simulations to reassess and
explain errors arising from the use of standard analysis
methods, which are based on continuous population synthesis
models: systematic errors on ages and random errors on masses
are large, while systematic errors on masses tend to be smaller.
The age-mass distributions obtained after analysis of a
synthetic sample are very similar to those found for real
galaxies in the literature. The Bayesian approach, on the other
hand, is very successful in recovering the input ages and masses
over ages ranging between 20 Myr and 1.5 Gyr, with only limited
systematics that we explain. \ Conclusions:
Considering stochasticity is important, more important for
instance than the choice of adding or removing near-IR data in
many cases. We found no immediately obvious reason to reject
priors inspired by previous (standard) analyses of cluster
populations in galaxies, i.e., cluster distributions that scale
with mass as M$^-2$ and are uniform on a logarithmic age
scale.},
