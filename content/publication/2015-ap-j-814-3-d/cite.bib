 abstract = {We map the distribution of dust in M31 at 25 pc resolution using stellar
photometry from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury
survey. The map is derived with a new technique that models the
near-infrared color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of red giant branch
(RGB) stars. The model CMDs combine an unreddened foreground of
RGB stars with a reddened background population viewed through a
log-normal column density distribution of dust. Fits to the
model constrain the median extinction, the width of the
extinction distribution, and the fraction of reddened stars in
each 25 pc cell. The resulting extinction map has a factor of
\ensuremath\gtrsim4 times better resolution than maps of
dust emission, while providing a more direct measurement of the
dust column. There is superb morphological agreement between the
new map and maps of the extinction inferred from dust emission
by Draine et al. However, the widely used Draine & Li dust
models overpredict the observed extinction by a factor of
\ensuremath∼2.5, suggesting that M31's true dust mass is
lower and that dust grains are significantly more emissive than
assumed in Draine et al. The observed factor of
\ensuremath∼2.5 discrepancy is consistent with similar
findings in the Milky Way by the Plank Collaboration et al., but
we find a more complex dependence on parameters from the Draine
& Li dust models. We also show that the the discrepancy with
the Draine et al. map is lowest where the current interstellar
radiation field has a harder spectrum than average. We discuss
possible improvements to the CMD dust mapping technique, and
explore further applications in both M31 and other galaxies.},
