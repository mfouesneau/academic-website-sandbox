 abstract = {We show that the masses of red giant stars can be well predicted from
their photospheric carbon and nitrogen abundances, in
conjunction with their spectroscopic stellar labels log g,
T$_eff$, and [Fe/H]. This is qualitatively expected from mass-
dependent post-main-sequence evolution. We here establish an
empirical relation between these quantities by drawing on 1475
red giants with asteroseismic mass estimates from Kepler that
also have spectroscopic labels from Apache Point Observatory
Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) DR12. We assess the
accuracy of our model, and find that it predicts stellar masses
with fractional rms errors of about 14 per cent (typically 0.2
M$_\ensuremathødot$). From these masses, we derive ages
with rms errors of 40 per cent. This empirical model allows us
for the first time to make age determinations (in the range 1-13
Gyr) for vast numbers of giant stars across the Galaxy. We apply
our model to \ensuremath∼52 000 stars in APOGEE DR12, for
which no direct mass and age information was previously
available. We find that these estimates highlight the vertical
age structure of the Milky Way disc, and that the relation of
age with [\ensuremathα/M] and metallicity is broadly
consistent with established expectations based on detailed
studies of the solar neighbourhood.},
