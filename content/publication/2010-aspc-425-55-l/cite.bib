 abstract = {The integrated properties of young star clusters are subject to large
cluster-to-cluster variations because they depend directly on
small numbers of bright stars. At ages at which red supergiants
are expected to exist, these luminous but rare stars can be
blamed for most of the variations. If unresolved clusters are to
be used to constrain red supergiant models, methods must be
developed that take these stochastic fluctuations into account.
We discuss prospects and open issues in this field, based on
recent work on high-mass clusters in M 82, and on first
experiments towards a Bayesian study of cluster populations.},
