 abstract = {Stellar distances constitute a foundational pillar of astrophysics. The
publication of 1.47 billion stellar parallaxes from Gaia is a
major contribution to this. Despite Gaia's precision, the
majority of these stars are so distant or faint that their
fractional parallax uncertainties are large, thereby precluding
a simple inversion of parallax to provide a distance. Here we
take a probabilistic approach to estimating stellar distances
that uses a prior constructed from a three-dimensional model of
our Galaxy. This model includes interstellar extinction and
Gaia's variable magnitude limit. We infer two types of distance.
The first, geometric, uses the parallax with a direction-
dependent prior on distance. The second, photogeometric,
additionally uses the color and apparent magnitude of a star, by
exploiting the fact that stars of a given color have a
restricted range of probable absolute magnitudes (plus
extinction). Tests on simulated data and external validations
show that the photogeometric estimates generally have higher
accuracy and precision for stars with poor parallaxes. We
provide a catalog of 1.47 billion geometric and 1.35 billion
photogeometric distances together with asymmetric uncertainty
measures. Our estimates are quantiles of a posterior probability
distribution, so they transform invariably and can therefore
also be used directly in the distance modulus (
$5\mathrmlog_10r\,-\,5$ ). The catalog may be downloaded
or queried using ADQL at various sites (see http://www.mpia.de/\
raisebox-0.5ex~calj/gedr3_distances.html),
where it can also be cross-matched with the Gaia catalog.},
