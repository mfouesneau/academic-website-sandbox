 abstract = {In a cosmological setting, the disk of a galaxy is expected to
continuously experience gravitational torques and perturbations
from a variety of sources, which can cause the disk to wobble,
flare and warp$^1,2$. Specifically, the study of galactic
warps and their dynamic nature could reveal key information on
the formation history of galaxies and the mass distribution of
their haloes. Our Milky Way presents a unique case study for
galactic warps, thanks to detailed knowledge of its stellar
distribution and kinematics. Using a simple model of how the
warp's orientation is changing with time, here, we measure the
precession rate of the Milky Way's warp using 12 million giant
stars from Gaia Data Release 2$^3$, finding that it is
precessing at 10.86 \ensuremath± 0.03 (statistical)
\ensuremath± 3.20 (systematic) km s$^-1$ kpc$^-1$ in
the direction of Galactic rotation, about one-third the angular
rotation velocity at the Sun's position in the Galaxy. The
direction and magnitude of the warp's precession rate favour the
scenario that the warp is the result of a recent or ongoing
encounter with a satellite galaxy, rather than the relic of the
ancient assembly history of the Galaxy.},
