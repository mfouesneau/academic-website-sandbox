 abstract = {We demonstrate a new method for measuring the escape fraction of
ionizing photons using Hubble Space Telescope imaging of
resolved stars in NGC 4214, a local analog of high-redshift
starburst galaxies that are thought to be responsible for cosmic
reionization. Specifically, we forward model the UV through
near-IR spectral energy distributions of
\ensuremathâˆ¼83,000 resolved stars to infer their
individual ionizing flux outputs. We constrain the local escape
fraction by comparing the number of ionizing photons produced by
stars to the number that are either absorbed by dust or consumed
by ionizing the surrounding neutral hydrogen in individual star-
forming regions. We find substantial spatial variation in the
escape fraction (0%-40%). Integrating over the entire galaxy
yields a global escape fraction of $25_-15^+16$ %. This
value is much higher than previous escape fractions of zero
reported for this galaxy. We discuss the sources of this
apparent tension and demonstrate that the viewing angle and 3D
interstellar medium geometric effects are the cause. If we
assume that NGC 4214 has no internal dust, like many high-
redshift galaxies, we find an escape fraction of 59% (an upper
limit for NGC 4214). This is the first nonzero escape fraction
measurement for UV-faint (M $_\mathrmFUV$ = -15.9)
galaxies at any redshift and supports the idea that starburst
UV-faint dwarf galaxies can provide a sufficient number of
ionizing photons to the intergalactic medium.},
