 abstract = {The [C II] 158 \ensuremathμm line is one of the strongest emission
lines observed in star-forming galaxies and has been empirically
measured to correlate with the star-formation rate (SFR)
globally and on kiloparsec scales. However, because of the
multiphase origins of [C II], one might expect this relation to
break down at small scales. We investigate the origins of [C II]
emission by examining high spatial resolution observations of [C
II] in M31 with the Survey of Lines in M31. We present five
åisebox-0.5ex~700 × 700 pc (3'
× 3') fields mapping the [C II] emission,
H\ensuremathα emission, and the ancillary infrared (IR)
data. We spatially separate star-forming regions from diffuse
gas and dust emission on \i̊sebox-0.5ex~50 pc
scales. We find that the [C II]-SFR correlation holds even at
these scales, although the relation typically has a flatter
slope than found at larger (kiloparsec) scales. While the
H\ensuremathα emission in M31 is concentrated in the
SFR regions, we find that a significant amount
(\rs̊ebox-0.5ex~20%-90%) of the [C II]
emission comes from outside star-forming regions and that the
total IR emission (TIR) has the highest diffuse fraction of all
SFR tracers. We find a weak correlation of the [C II]/TIR to
dust color in each field and find a large-scale trend of
increasing [C II]/TIR with galactocentric radius. The
differences in the relative diffuse fractions of [C II],
H\ensuremathα, and IR tracers are likely caused by a
combination of energetic photon leakage from H II regions and
heating by the diffuse radiation field arising from older
(B-star) stellar populations. However, we find that by averaging
our measurements over kiloparsec scales, these effects are
minimized, and the relation between [C II] and SFR found in
other nearby galaxy studies is retrieved.},
