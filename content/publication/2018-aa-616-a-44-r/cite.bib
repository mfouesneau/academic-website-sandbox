 abstract = {We present a map of the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of dust in
the Orion complex. Orion is the closest site of high-mass star
formation, making it an excellent laboratory for studying the
interstellar medium and star formation. We used data from the
Gaia-TGAS catalogue combined with photometry from 2MASS and WISE
to get the distances and extinctions of individual stars in the
vicinity of the Orion complex. We use a Gaussian process and
adopt a non-parametric method to infer the probability
distribution function of the dust densities at arbitrary points
throughout the region. We map the dust distribution towards
different parts of the Orion complex. We find that the distance
and depth of the cloud are compatible with other recent works,
which show that the method can be applicable to local molecular
clouds to map their 3D dust distribution. We also demonstrate
the danger of only using colours of stars to derive their
extinctions without considering further physical constraints,
such as the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD).},
