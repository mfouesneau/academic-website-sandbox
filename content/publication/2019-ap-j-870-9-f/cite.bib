 abstract = {Observational tests of stellar and Galactic chemical evolution call for
the joint knowledge of a star\textquoterights physical
parameters, detailed element abundances, and precise age. For
cool main-sequence (MS) stars the abundances of many elements
can be measured from spectroscopy, but ages are very hard to
determine. The situation is different if the MS star has a white
dwarf (WD) companion and a known distance, as the age of such a
binary system can then be determined precisely from the
photometric properties of the cooling WD. As a pilot study for
obtaining precise age determinations of field MS stars, we
identify nearly 100 candidates for such wide binary systems: a
faint WD whose GPS1 proper motion matches that of a brighter MS
star in Gaia/TGAS with a good parallax (\ensuremathσ
$_ \ensuremathǎrpi $/\ensuremath\řpi
\ensuremathłeq 0.05). We model the WD\textquoterights
multi-band photometry with the BASE-9 code using this precise
distance (assumed to be common for the pair) and infer ages for
each binary system. The resulting age estimates are precise to
\ensuremathłeq10% (\ensuremathłeq20%) for 42 (67)
MS-WD systems. Our analysis more than doubles the number of MS-
WD systems with precise distances known to date, and it boosts
the number of such systems with precise age determination by an
order of magnitude. With the advent of the Gaia DR2 data, this
approach will be applicable to a far larger sample, providing
ages for many MS stars (that can yield detailed abundances for
over 20 elements), especially in the age range of 2-8 \Gyr\,
where there are only few known star clusters.},
