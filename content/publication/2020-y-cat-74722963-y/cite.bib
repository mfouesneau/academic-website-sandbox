 abstract = {In conjunction with the photometric component of Pristine, a
spectroscopic follow-up programme has been observing the most
promising, bright (V<18) metal-poor candidates on 2-4m class
telescopes with medium- and high-resolution spectrographs. In
this paper, we focus on the homogeneous follow-up sample of 205
candidate stars observed with the Intermediate Dispersion
Spectrograph (IDS) on the 2.5m Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) over
the period of 2016 March 18-27, May 15-23, July 20-24 and
September 2-6, and with the Intermediate dispersion Spectrograph
and Imaging System (ISIS) on the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope
(WHT) over the period of 2016 May 1-2 and July 29-31 (Programs
C71 and N5). Both telescopes are located at the Roque de Los
Muchachos Observatory in La Palma, Canary Islands.
