abstract: "In conjunction with the photometric component of Pristine, a spectroscopic follow-up programme has been observing the most promising, bright (V<18) metal-poor candidates on 2-4m class telescopes with medium- and high-resolution spectrographs. In this paper, we focus on the homogeneous follow-up sample of 205 candidate stars observed with the Intermediate Dispersion Spectrograph (IDS) on the 2.5m Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) over the period of 2016 March 18-27, May 15-23, July 20-24 and September 2-6, and with the Intermediate dispersion Spectrograph and Imaging System (ISIS) on the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope (WHT) over the period of 2016 May 1-2 and July 29-31 (Programs C71 and N5). Both telescopes are located at the Roque de Los Muchachos Observatory in La Palma, Canary Islands. (2 data files)."
