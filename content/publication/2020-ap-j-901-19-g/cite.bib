 abstract = {The presence of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in clusters provides
key constraints for stellar models, as has been demonstrated
with historical data from the Magellanic Clouds. In this work,
we look for candidate AGB stars in M31 star clusters from the
Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury survey. Our photometric
criteria selects stars brighter than the tip of the red giant
branch, which includes the bulk of the thermally pulsing AGB
stars as well as early-AGB stars and other luminous cool giants
expected in young stellar populations (e.g., massive red
supergiants, and intermediate-mass red helium-burning stars).
The AGB stars can be differentiated, a posteriori, using the
ages already estimated for our cluster sample. 937 candidates
are found within the cluster aperture radii, half
(\ensuremath∼450) of which are very likely cluster
members. Cross-matching with additional databases reveals two
carbon stars and 10 secure variables among them. The field-
corrected age distribution reveals the presence of young
supergiants peaking at ages smaller than 10$^8$ yr, followed
by a long tail of AGB stars extending up to the oldest possible
ages. This long tail reveals the general decrease in the numbers
of AGB stars from initial values of $∼ 50\times
10^-6M_ødot ^-1$ at 10$^8$ yr down to $∼
5\times 10^-6M_ødot ^-1$ at 10$^10$ yr.
Theoretical models of near-solar metallicity reproduce this
general trend, although with localized discrepancies over some
age intervals, whose origin is not yet identified. The entire
catalog is released together with finding charts to facilitate
follow-up studies.},
