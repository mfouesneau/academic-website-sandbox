 abstract = {We employ Pan-STARRS photometry, Gaia trigonometric parallaxes, modern
stellar evolution and atmosphere models, and our Bayesian
fitting approach to determine cooling and total ages for 159,238
white dwarfs. In many cases we are able to derive precise ages
(better than 5%) for individual white dwarfs. These results are
meant for broad use within the white dwarf and stellar
astrophysics communities and we plan to make available on-line
the posterior distributions for cooling age, total age, initial
stellar mass, and other parameters.},
