 abstract = {In the Milky Way, the thick disk can be defined using individual stellar
abundances, kinematics, or age, or geometrically, as stars high
above the midplane. In nearby galaxies, where only a geometric
definition can be used, thick disks appear to have large radial
scale lengths, and their red colors suggest that they are
uniformly old. The Milky Way\textquoterights geometrically
thick disk is also radially extended, but it is far from
chemically uniform: \ensuremathα-enhanced stars are
confined within the inner Galaxy. In simulated galaxies, where
old stars are centrally concentrated, geometrically thick disks
are radially extended, too. Younger stellar populations flare in
the simulated disks\textquoteright outer regions, bringing
those stars high above the midplane. The resulting geometrically
thick disks therefore show a radial age gradient, from old in
their central regions to younger in their outskirts. Based on
our age estimates for a large sample of giant stars in the
APOGEE survey, we can now test this scenario for the Milky Way.
We find that the geometrically defined thick disk in the Milky
Way has indeed a strong radial age gradient: the median age for
red clump stars goes from \ensuremath∼9 Gyr in the inner
disk to 5 Gyr in the outer disk. We propose that at least some
nearby galaxies could also have thick disks that are not
uniformly old, and that geometrically thick disks might be
complex structures resulting from different formation mechanisms
in their inner and outer parts.},
