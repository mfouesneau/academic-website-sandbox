 abstract = {Interstellar dust affects many astronomical observations through
absorption and reddening, yet this extinction is also a powerful
tool for studying interstellar matter in galaxies. Three-
dimensional (3D) reconstructions of dust extinction and density
in the Milky Way have suffered from artefacts such as the
fingers-of-god effect and negative densities, and have been
limited by large computational costs. Here, we aim to overcome
these issues with a novel algorithm that derives the 3D
extinction density of dust in the Milky Way using a latent
variable Gaussian process in combination with variational
inference. Our model maintains non-negative density and hence
monotonically non-decreasing extinction along all lines-of-
sight, while performing the inference within a reasonable
computational time. Using extinctions for hundreds of thousands
of stars computed from optical and near-infrared photometry,
together with distances based on Gaia parallaxes, we employ our
algorithm to infer the structure of the Orion, Taurus, Perseus,
and Cygnus X star-forming regions. A number of features that are
superimposed in 2D extinction maps are clearly deblended in 3D
dust extinction density maps. For example, we find a large
filament on the edge of Orion that may host a number of star
clusters. We also identify a coherent structure that may link
the Taurus and Perseus regions, and we show that Cygnus X is
located at 1300-1500 pc, in line with very-long-baseline
interferometry measurements. We compute dust masses of the
regions and find these to be slightly higher than previous
estimates, likely a consequence of our input data recovering the
highest column densities more effectively. By comparing our
predicted extinctions to Planck data, we find that known
relationships between density and dust processing, where high-
extinction lines-of-sight have the most processed grains, hold
up in resolved observations when density is included, and that
they exist at smaller scales than previously suggested. This can
be used to study the changes in size or composition of dust as
they are processed in molecular clouds.
