 abstract = {The second Gaia data release (Gaia DR2) contains, beyond the astrometry,
three-band photometry for 1.38 billion sources. One band is the
G band, the other two were obtained by integrating the Gaia
prism spectra (BP and RP). We have used these three broad
photometric bands to infer stellar effective temperatures,
T$_eff$, for all sources brighter than G = 17 mag with
T$_eff$ in the range 3000-10 000 K (some 161 million sources).
Using in addition the parallaxes, we infer the line-of-sight
extinction, A$_G$, and the reddening, E(BP - RP), for 88
million sources. Together with a bolometric correction we derive
luminosity and radius for 77 million sources. These quantities
as well as their estimated uncertainties are part of Gaia DR2.
Here we describe the procedures by which these quantities were
obtained, including the underlying assumptions, comparison with
literature estimates, and the limitations of our results.
Typical accuracies are of order 324 K (T$_eff$), 0.46 mag
(A$_G$), 0.23 mag (E(BP - RP)), 15% (luminosity), and 10%
(radius). Being based on only a small number of observable
quantities and limited training data, our results are
necessarily subject to some extreme assumptions that can lead to
strong systematics in some cases (not included in the
aforementioned accuracy estimates). One aspect is the non-
negativity contraint of our estimates, in particular extinction,
which we discuss. Yet in several regions of parameter space our
results show very good performance, for example for red clump
stars and solar analogues. Large uncertainties render the
extinctions less useful at the individual star level, but they
show good performance for ensemble estimates. We identify
regimes in which our parameters should and should not be used
and we define a ``clean'' sample. Despite the limitations, this
is the largest catalogue of uniformly-inferred stellar
parameters to date. More precise and detailed astrophysical
parameters based on the full BP/RP spectrophotometry are planned
as part of the third Gaia data release.},
