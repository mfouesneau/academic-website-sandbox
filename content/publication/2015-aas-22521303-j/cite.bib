 abstract = {Theoretical studies of star cluster formation suggest that the star
formation efficiency (SFE) of a cluster's progenitor cloud
dictates whether or not a gravitationally bound grouping will
emerge from an embedded region after gas expulsion. I measure
the fraction of stars formed in long-lived clusters relative to
unbound field stars on a spatial resolved basis in the Andromeda
galaxy. These observations test theoretical predictions that
star clusters are formed within a hierarchical interstellar
medium at peaks in the gas density where local SFEs are enhanced
and regions become stellar dominated. Using data from the
Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey and
ancillary observations of M31's gas phase, I investigate how
cluster formation correlates with galactic environment and
galaxy-scale properties of the star formation. We construct a
sample of >2700 star clusters through a crowd-sourced visual
search of the high spatial resolution HST imaging data. Our
catalog uses åisebox-0.5ex~2 million image
classifications collected by the Andromeda Project citizen
science website to provide an unparalleled census of clusters
that spans \i̊sebox-0.5ex~4 orders of magnitude
in mass (50% completeness at
\rs̊ebox-0.5ex~500 M$_\ensuremathødot$
at <100 Myr) and increases the number of known clusters within
the PHAT survey footprint by a factor of
\rae̊box-0.5ex~6. Cluster ages and masses are
obtained by fitting to color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of
individually resolved stars within each cluster. Furthermore, we
insure our ability to accurately interpret cluster age and mass
distributions through careful catalog completeness
characterization, made possible by thousands of synthetic
cluster tests included during catalog construction work. We
combine our high quality cluster sample with spatially resolved
star formation histories, derived from CMD fitting of PHAT's
photometry of \raib̊ox-0.5ex~117 million
resolved field stars. We derived the fraction of stars formed in
long-lived clusters and show that only a few percent of coeval
stars are found in clusters within the 10-100 Myr age range.
These results are consistent with theoretical predictions of
declining bound fractions with decreasing star formation rate
density.},
