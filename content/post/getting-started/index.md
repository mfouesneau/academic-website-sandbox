I recently got this tenure job (yay!) of data scientist at [MPIA](https://www.mpia.de/en/).
In this new role, I want to support scientists to carry out novel, cutting-edge research and to establish MPIA as a world-wide leader in astronomical data science.

* Solidify foundational hacking & coding skill.
* Provide a space to explore and develop data science skills.
* Networking, outside presence and broader impact
* Help the career development of my colleagues.

I felt that I should have a place to store and publish notes and ideas. I am therefore creating this new website which offers blog type publications.

I am basing my website on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/) and in particular the [Academic](https://academic-demo.netlify.app/) template.

So far it is relatively simple to edit, though I am still making a first version that I like.
However, my first impression is that the structure of the repository is cluttered. I wish it would be cleaned up. Also I am not a bit fan of using a third party service to publish the website. By default you are guided to use [Netlify](netlify.com). I am sure I'll migrate to pure github and github actions.
